  Improve the project's stack packs from what its builds keep repeating. Opt-in via .karta/kaizen.json, and the switch is absolute: absent or disabled means kaizen never runs, even when invoked directly. When on, it seeds every pack the project uses into .karta/sme/ on the first enabled run, then writes pack edits as labeled kaizen: commits a human reviews — it never weakens a rule and never promotes a pack to enforcing. Phase one ships the frame; sharpening rules and suggesting new packs come in later phases. Trigger phrases: "run kaizen", "kaizen the packs", "improve the stack packs".

`karta-kaizen` turns what a project's builds keep repeating into better stack packs. It dispatches one karta-owned agent — `karta-kaizen` — a writer confined to `.karta/sme/` and its own config area, whose every change lands as a commit a human reviews. This skill is the only place that agent is dispatched; it is the pack analog of `karta-doc-gardner`: a thin orchestrator around a single writer.

**This is phase one: the frame.** What runs today is the seed-all step and the write-commit-review loop. The behaviors that will make kaizen earn its keep — sharpening rules from repeated `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` markers, plain "this rule is eroding" notes, spotting gaps and suggesting new packs — are later phases and are not active yet. This skill does not pretend to them.

## Opt-in — `.karta/kaizen.json` (the switch is absolute)

Read `.karta/kaizen.json`:

- `{"enabled": true}` (optionally `"focus": "<freeform note>"`) → opted in. `karta-deliver` runs this skill after each delivery, and a direct invocation works too.
- Absent, or `{"enabled": false}` → kaizen **never runs — including when this skill is invoked directly.** This is stricter than doc-gardner on purpose: doc-gardner's switch governs only its automatic delivery path and a standalone run works regardless; kaizen has no standalone carve-out. Off means off. When the switch is off and someone invokes this skill, report that kaizen is off — and that `.karta/kaizen.json` with `"enabled": true` turns it on — then stop. Do not dispatch the agent.

`focus` is a plain nudge about what to watch (for example "watch the billing items and the auth rules"). It is not a task list. The file shape is gated by [references/kaizen-schema.json](references/kaizen-schema.json); see [references/kaizen.example.json](references/kaizen.example.json). The plugin validator schema-checks the file when a repo commits one.

## Inputs

- **Repo root** — the working tree whose packs kaizen improves (the integration branch's tree in a delivery).
- **Mode** — `delivery` (commit the pack edits) or `direct` (leave the working-tree edits for the caller). An explicit signal from the caller; default `direct`.
- **Binder slug** — in delivery mode, for the commit label.
- **Focus** — the optional `focus` string from `.karta/kaizen.json`, passed through to the agent.

## Resolving the kaizen agent (any runtime)

The agent is a **writer** (it edits packs), so it needs a write-capable sandbox. Resolve it the way the runtime supports:

1. **A registered `karta-kaizen` subagent exists** — dispatch it by name. This is the path on Claude Code (the plugin bundles it) and on Codex when the project carries `.codex/agents/karta-kaizen.toml` (there `sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"` is set).
2. **No registered agent by that name** (a Codex plugin install, which cannot register subagents) — spawn a fresh write-capable subagent (a normal worker, not the read-only explorer) and give it, as its complete instructions, the bundled agent file: [references/karta-kaizen.agent.md](references/karta-kaizen.agent.md). That file is the agent's own instructions and is self-contained.

## Phase 1 — Check the switch  `kaizen:switch`

Read `.karta/kaizen.json`. If it is absent, unparseable, or `enabled` is not `true`, report that kaizen is off and stop — even on a direct invocation. Otherwise read `focus` (may be absent) and continue.

## Phase 2 — Resolve the pack set  `kaizen:packs`

Resolve every pack the project uses: the always-on built-ins plus every built-in whose `match` hits the project's stack, from karta's bundled pack set (the same built-ins the karta-plan, karta-build, and karta-verify skills carry), laid under the project's own `.karta/sme/*.md` — on a name clash the project's copy wins. Hand the agent the resolved list, each id with the path to its source file. The skill resolves this because the built-in packs live in the installed plugin, not necessarily in the repo.

## Phase 3 — Dispatch the writer  `kaizen:write`

Dispatch `karta-kaizen` (resolved as above) with the repo root, the resolved pack list, and the focus note. On the first enabled run the agent seeds `.karta/sme/` — every used pack copied in as a full file, existing project copies left untouched. Beyond seeding, phase one edits a pack only on a concrete instruction carried in the dispatch, and the agent never weakens a rule or promotes a pack to enforcing. It returns a terse envelope (`seeded`, `packs_changed`, `residual`, `summary`).

## Phase 4 — Land or hand back  `kaizen:land`

- **`Mode: delivery`** — the agent's edits are in the integration branch's working tree. If `packs_changed` is non-empty, stage the changed files under `.karta/sme/` and commit them as a labeled kaizen commit on the integration branch: `kaizen: <short summary>` (for a seed run, `kaizen: seed <n> packs into .karta/sme/`), carrying the agent's `summary` in the body and any `residual` as a trailer. The human reviewing the branch reviews these commits like any other. If nothing changed, make no commit. Never push.
- **`Mode: direct`** — leave the edits in the working tree and report the envelope to the caller; the user reviews and commits. Make no commit yourself.

Fold the envelope into the caller's report. Write everything you show a person in plain language — the agent routes its human-facing output through the karta-plainlanguage skill, and so does this skill.

## Rules

- **One agent, packs only.** The kaizen agent writes inside `.karta/sme/` and `.karta/kaizen.json` — never code, tests, the binder, git refs, prose docs, or karta's built-in packs. This skill never edits anything itself — it dispatches and (in delivery mode) commits the agent's pack edits.
- **The switch is absolute.** Absent or disabled means kaizen never runs, direct invocation included. There is no standalone carve-out.
- **Never weaker.** No rule loosened or removed, no pack promoted to enforcing — changing what gates a build is the human's decision, made in review of kaizen's commits.
- **Seed once, full files.** The first enabled run copies every used pack into `.karta/sme/` whole; a project's existing copy always wins. From then on the repo owns its packs, and the built-ins cover only names the repo does not carry.
- **Labeled, revertible commits.** In delivery mode every change is a `kaizen:` commit on the integration branch — never pushed, never on a protected branch — reviewed and revertible like any commit.
- **Plain language to people, precision in packs.** Human-facing output goes through the karta-plainlanguage skill; pack content stays technical.
- **Phase-one honesty.** Sharpening, erosion notes, and new-pack suggestion are later phases. Report what ran and no more.
