# SME Domain-Expert Packs Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Give karta a curated, auto-applied domain-expertise layer. SME packs come in two kinds — **stack packs** (matched by tech: angular, python-fastapi) and **rule packs** (apply to every binder: minimalism, distilled from ponytail's ladder at the "full" level). Each pack's diff-checkable Review checklist is enforced by the existing safety-auditor. v2 also borrows ponytail's debt mechanics (a ceiling/upgrade marker grammar, a no-trigger rot flag, a read-only `karta-debt` harvest skill) and adds a `benchmarks/sme/` method to prove a pack helps.

**Architecture:** SME packs are markdown reference files (built-in under `skills/_shared/sme/`, project overlay under `.karta/sme/`). A pack is a **stack pack** (`match: [tokens]`) or a **rule pack** (`always: true`). karta-plan applies rule packs to every binder and stack packs by match, then pins all applied ids in the binder's `sme[]` field. karta-build loads the applied packs to write against and self-checks its diff before commit, recording declared overrides as inline `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <reason> [ceiling: …; upgrade: …]` markers. karta-verify resolves the pinned packs' Review checklists and passes them to `karta-safety-auditor`, which — only when `sme[]` is non-empty — flags any **undeclared** checklist violation as a boundary VIOLATION. The acceptance-reviewer stays SME-unaware; one acceptance authority. ponytail's `platform-native.md` substitution tables ship as a shared reference (`skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md`) that the minimalism + stack packs link to (reference, don't copy).

**Tech Stack:** Markdown skills/agents (Claude + Codex plugin), small Python 3.11 scripts run via `uv` (`jsonschema`), JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12). New: one read-only skill (`karta-debt`) and a `benchmarks/sme/` runner. The matcher and build self-check remain SKILL.md prose, not new scripts.

## Global Constraints

- **Spec:** `docs/specs/2026-06-21-sme-domain-experts-design.md` is the source of truth. Read it before starting.
- **Advisory to write by; only the Review checklist is enforceable.** Do / Don't / Patterns never block. A checklist deviation passes when declared with a rationale (an inline `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <reason>` marker); an **undeclared** checklist violation is a safety-auditor VIOLATION.
- **One acceptance authority.** `karta-acceptance-reviewer` stays SME-unaware. SME enforcement is one **conditional** check on `karta-safety-auditor`, active only when the binder's `sme[]` is non-empty. No new gate; no new *agent* (the new `karta-debt` skill is read-only and dispatches nothing).
- **Two pack kinds, one mechanism.** Stack packs carry `match: [tokens]`; rule packs carry `always: true`. They differ only in *selection* — both pin in `sme[]`, both write against the implementer, both are enforced through the Review checklist. The first rule pack is `minimalism` at ponytail's "full" level. **No intensity dial.**
- **Checklist items must be diff-checkable.** Every `## Review checklist` item (stack or rule) must be objectively checkable on a diff. Heuristics ("prefer the simplest thing", the ladder) stay in Do / Don't / Patterns / advisory sections. This is what lets the minimalism rule pack be enforced without the gate judging a vibe.
- **No per-stack/per-rule control flow.** Packs are data; the matcher, self-check, and auditor check are generic. No `case "angular"` or `case "minimalism"` anywhere in code or prose.
- **No tracked backlog.** The rot flag and `karta-debt` are one-shot and read-only. karta still never persists, schedules, or revisits debt.
- **Attribution.** `platform-native.md` and the `minimalism` pack adapt content from ponytail (MIT). Keep an attribution line in those files' headers.
- **Matching and the build self-check are SKILL.md prose,** not new scripts. Existing scripts that change: `validate_binder.py`, `check_shared_copies.py`. New code is the `karta-debt` skill (read-only; may carry a small grep helper) and the `benchmarks/sme/` runner.
- **Token is `sme`.** Built-in packs: `skills/_shared/sme/<id>.md`. Per-consumer byte-equal copies: `skills/{karta-plan,karta-build,karta-verify}/references/sme/<id>.md`. Project overlay: `.karta/sme/<id>.md` (project-local wins on a `name` clash).
- **Canonical → generated discipline (AGENTS.md).** Edit canonical, then regenerate. Canonical: `skills/<name>/`, `skills/_shared/`, `agents/<name>.md`. Generated (never hand-edit): `.agents/skills/`, `plugins/karta/`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, `skills/karta-verify/references/*.agent.md`. After editing a gate agent run `uv run scripts/sync_codex_agents.py` **then** `uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py`; after editing any skill/reference run `uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py`. Each commit must leave all four pre-commit checks green: `uv run scripts/validate_plugin.py --self-test`, `uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test`, `uv run scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --check`, `uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check`.
- **Markdown rules:** tables use minimum separators (`|-|-|`); never box-drawing characters. Never write the phrase "load bearing" or "fencing".
- **Branch:** all work lands on `feat/sme-domain-experts` (already checked out).

## File Structure

New canonical files:
- `skills/_shared/sme/angular.md` — stack pack: Angular do's/don'ts + Review checklist (with a native-input item) + `see_also`.
- `skills/_shared/sme/python-fastapi.md` — stack pack: Python/Pydantic/FastAPI do's/don'ts + Review checklist (with a stdlib item) + `see_also`.
- `skills/_shared/sme/minimalism.md` — **rule pack** (`always: true`): ponytail "full" ladder (advisory) + safety floor + diff-checkable Review checklist.
- `skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md` — shared reference data (not a pack): native/stdlib substitution tables, attributed to ponytail (MIT).
- `skills/karta-debt/SKILL.md` — **new read-only skill**: on-demand repo-wide harvest of `KARTA-DEFER` + `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` markers; grouped, rot-flagged; writes nothing.
- `benchmarks/sme/README.md`, `benchmarks/sme/fixtures/*`, `benchmarks/sme/run.py` — A/B pack-effectiveness method + semi-automated runner.

New byte-equal copies (kept equal to `_shared` by `check_shared_copies.py`) — every `_shared/sme/*.md` into each of the three consumers:
- `skills/karta-plan/references/sme/*.md`
- `skills/karta-build/references/sme/*.md`
- `skills/karta-verify/references/sme/*.md`

Modified canonical files:
- `scripts/check_shared_copies.py` — recurse into `_shared` subdirs; path-relative keying.
- `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-schema.json` — add top-level `sme`.
- `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-reference.md` — document `sme`.
- `skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py` — self-test cases for `sme`.
- `skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md` — config row, matcher (rule packs always-apply + stack packs by match), domain-guidance, pin, report line.
- `skills/karta-build/SKILL.md` — config row, cache `SME_PACKS`, load packs, self-check + ceiling/upgrade markers, report tally, no-trigger rot flag in the debt register.
- `agents/karta-safety-auditor.md` — conditional SME-norm conformance check.
- `skills/karta-verify/SKILL.md` — resolve checklists, pass into the auditor dispatch.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` / `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` — register the `karta-debt` skill (keep name/version in step).
- `AGENTS.md`, `README.md` — layout rows + SME section (both pack kinds, minimalism, karta-debt, measurement).

Regenerated (by the sync scripts; commit them, never hand-edit):
- `.agents/skills/**`, `plugins/karta/**`, `.codex/agents/karta-safety-auditor.toml`, `skills/karta-verify/references/karta-safety-auditor.agent.md`.

### Task 1: Author the built-in SME packs + shared platform-native reference

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/_shared/sme/angular.md` (stack pack)
- Create: `skills/_shared/sme/python-fastapi.md` (stack pack)
- Create: `skills/_shared/sme/minimalism.md` (rule pack)
- Create: `skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md` (shared reference data)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: two **stack packs** (`name`: `angular`, `python-fastapi`; frontmatter `match` + `see_also`), one **rule pack** (`name`: `minimalism`; frontmatter `always: true`), and the shared **`platform-native.md`** reference (no `name`/`match`/`always` — it is data the packs link to). Every pack body has a `## Review checklist` of diff-checkable `- [ ]` items. These ids are what later tasks apply, pin, load, and enforce.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `skills/_shared/sme/angular.md`**

```markdown
---
name: angular
description: Angular architecture do's and don'ts
match: ["@angular/core", "@angular/cli", "angular"]
see_also: ["platform-native#html-elements", "platform-native#css-capabilities"]
---
## Do
- Use standalone components, directives, and pipes; avoid declaring them in NgModules.
- Use signals (`signal`, `computed`, `effect`) for local component state; prefer the `inject()` function over constructor injection.
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on components.
- Use typed reactive forms (`FormGroup`/`FormControl` with explicit types) for non-trivial input.
- Clean up subscriptions with `takeUntilDestroyed()` or the `async` pipe; prefer the `async` pipe over manual subscription.
- Lazy-load feature routes with `loadComponent` / `loadChildren`.

## Don't
- Don't put logic in templates beyond simple expressions; move it to the component or a pipe.
- Don't use `any`; type inputs, outputs, and service results.
- Don't call `.subscribe()` without a teardown path.
- Don't mutate `@Input()` values; treat inputs as read-only.
- Don't reach into the DOM with `ElementRef.nativeElement` when a binding or directive will do.

## Patterns
- Smart/presentational split: container components own data and effects; presentational components take inputs and emit outputs.
- One responsibility per service; provide app-wide singletons with `providedIn: 'root'`.
- Co-locate a component's template, styles, and spec with the component.

## Review checklist
- [ ] No `any` in changed component/service signatures.
- [ ] Every new component declares `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
- [ ] No `.subscribe()` without `takeUntilDestroyed()`, an `async` pipe, or an explicit unsubscribe.
- [ ] New components/directives/pipes are `standalone`, not added to an NgModule's `declarations`.
- [ ] No business logic embedded in a template expression.
- [ ] No date/color/range/time-picker dependency where a native `<input type=…>` covers it (see platform-native).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write `skills/_shared/sme/python-fastapi.md`**

```markdown
---
name: python-fastapi
description: Python + Pydantic + FastAPI do's and don'ts
match: ["fastapi", "pydantic", "python"]
see_also: ["platform-native#python-standard-library", "platform-native#database"]
---
## Do
- Define request and response bodies as Pydantic models; set `response_model` on routes.
- Use type hints on every function signature; let FastAPI derive validation from them.
- Use dependency injection (`Depends`) for shared resources (DB sessions, auth, settings).
- Use `async def` for I/O-bound path operations; keep blocking work off the event loop.
- Load configuration through `pydantic-settings` (`BaseSettings`), not bare `os.environ` reads scattered in code.
- Raise `HTTPException` (or a registered exception handler) for error responses; return typed models for success.

## Don't
- Don't return raw `dict`s from routes when a response model fits; don't leak ORM models directly as response bodies.
- Don't use mutable default arguments; don't use bare `except:`.
- Don't do blocking I/O (sync DB driver, `requests`, `time.sleep`) inside an `async def` route.
- Don't put secrets or environment-specific values in source; read them through settings.
- Don't disable Pydantic validation to make a check pass.

## Patterns
- Routers per resource (`APIRouter`), included into the app; keep `main.py` thin.
- A service/repository layer between routes and the data store; routes stay declarative.
- Pydantic v2 idioms: `model_config`, `field_validator`, `model_validator`; `ConfigDict` over class-based `Config`.

## Review checklist
- [ ] Every changed route declares request/response types (Pydantic model or explicit `response_model`).
- [ ] No bare `except:` and no mutable default arguments in changed code.
- [ ] No blocking I/O inside an `async def` route.
- [ ] New config/secrets read through a settings object, not inline `os.environ`.
- [ ] Changed public functions carry type hints on params and return.
- [ ] No third-party wrapper for what the stdlib ships (`uuid`, `pathlib`, `zoneinfo`, `datetime.fromisoformat`) — name the stdlib equivalent (see platform-native).
```

- [ ] **Step 2b: Write the `minimalism` rule pack** (`skills/_shared/sme/minimalism.md`)

The ladder is advisory (ponytail "full"); only the Review checklist is enforced, and every item is diff-checkable.

```markdown
---
name: minimalism
description: Write the least code that works; don't over-build (ponytail "full")
always: true
see_also: ["platform-native"]
---
<!-- Adapted from ponytail (https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail), MIT. -->
## The ladder (advisory — shapes how you write, never gates)
Stop at the first rung that holds:
1. Does this need to exist at all? Speculative need = skip it, say so in one line (YAGNI).
2. Stdlib does it? Use it.
3. Native platform feature covers it? Use it (see platform-native).
4. Already-installed dependency solves it? Use it. Never add a new dependency for what a few lines do.
5. Can it be one line? One line.
6. Only then: the minimum code that works.

## Never simplify away (safety floor)
Validation at trust boundaries, error handling that prevents data loss, security, accessibility basics, anything explicitly requested, and hardware calibration knobs are never on the chopping block. Lazy means less code, not a flimsier algorithm.

## Patterns (advisory)
- No unrequested abstractions: no interface with one implementation, no factory for one product.
- Deletion over addition; boring over clever; fewest files; shortest working diff.

## Review checklist (enforced — diff-checkable only)
- [ ] No new third-party dependency where the stdlib or platform already ships it — name the dep and the native equivalent (see platform-native).
- [ ] No abstraction with a single implementation/caller added speculatively (interface, factory, wrapper that only delegates).
- [ ] No new config key, flag, or option that nothing reads.
- [ ] Non-trivial new logic (a branch, loop, parser, money/security path) leaves one runnable check (an `assert`-based self-check or one small test).
```

- [ ] **Step 2c: Write the shared `platform-native.md` reference** (`skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md`)

This is reference data the packs link to (no `name`/`match`/`always`). Adapt ponytail's tables; keep the attribution line. Use `##` section headings whose slugs match the `see_also` anchors (`html-elements`, `css-capabilities`, `python-standard-library`, `database`, plus `javascript-browser-apis`, `nodejs-standard-library`).

```markdown
# Platform-native solutions

<!-- Adapted from ponytail (https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail), MIT. -->

The lazy senior dev's first question: does the platform already do this? Before adding a dependency, scan here.

## HTML elements
| You think you need | The platform has |
|-|-|
| Date / time / color / range picker library | `<input type="date|time|color|range">` |
| Modal/dialog library | `<dialog>` + `dialog.showModal()` |
| Accordion component | `<details><summary>…</summary></details>` |
| Progress / meter component | `<progress>` / `<meter>` |

## CSS capabilities
| You reach for JS for | CSS has |
|-|-|
| Responsive font size | `font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem)` |
| Dark mode | `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` |
| Responsive grid without breakpoints | `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))` |
| Sticky header | `position: sticky; top: 0` |

## JavaScript / browser APIs
| You think you need | The runtime ships |
|-|-|
| `query-string` / `qs` | `new URLSearchParams(location.search)` |
| `lodash.clonedeep` | `structuredClone(obj)` |
| `uuid` v4 | `crypto.randomUUID()` |
| `date-fns` format | `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(...)` |
| `clipboard.js` | `navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)` |

## Node.js standard library
| You think you need | Node has |
|-|-|
| `mkdirp` | `fs.mkdirSync(path, { recursive: true })` |
| `rimraf` | `fs.rmSync(path, { recursive: true, force: true })` |
| `uuid` v4 | `crypto.randomUUID()` |
| `array-uniq` | `[...new Set(arr)]` |

## Python standard library
| You think you need | Python ships |
|-|-|
| `python-dateutil` (basic) | `datetime.fromisoformat()` |
| `pytz` | `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("America/New_York")` |
| `attrs` (simple) | `@dataclass` |
| `uuid` lib confusion | `uuid` is stdlib — just `import uuid` |
| `click` (single command) | `argparse` |

## Database
| You think you need app code for | The database has |
|-|-|
| Pagination | `LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40` |
| Uniqueness | `UNIQUE` constraint, not app-level checks |
| Referential integrity | `FOREIGN KEY`, not app-level checks |
| Value ranges | `CHECK (price > 0)` |
| UUID generation | `gen_random_uuid()` (Postgres) |

When the native solution is genuinely insufficient (old browser support, edge cases, ergonomics at scale), the library earns its place. Install it then, not before.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Verify the packs + reference are well-formed**

Run:
```bash
# stack + rule packs carry a name and a Review checklist
for p in angular python-fastapi minimalism; do
  f="skills/_shared/sme/$p.md"
  grep -q "^name: $p$" "$f" && grep -q "^## Review checklist" "$f" && grep -qE "^- \[ \] " "$f" \
    && echo "$p OK" || echo "$p MALFORMED"
done
# selection: stack packs match; the rule pack is always:true
grep -q "^match:" skills/_shared/sme/angular.md \
  && grep -q "^always: true$" skills/_shared/sme/minimalism.md && echo "selection OK"
# platform-native is reference data (no selection frontmatter); carries the see_also anchors + attribution
grep -q "^## HTML elements" skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md \
  && grep -qi "ponytail" skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md && echo "platform-native OK"
```
Expected: `angular OK`, `python-fastapi OK`, `minimalism OK`, `selection OK`, `platform-native OK`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Confirm the pre-commit checks are still green** (`_shared` files are not mirrored and have no copies yet)

Run: `uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test`
Expected: `SHARED COPIES: IN SYNC`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/_shared/sme/
git commit -m "feat(sme): built-in packs — angular, python-fastapi, minimalism + platform-native ref"
```

---

### Task 2: Generalize `check_shared_copies.py` for nested subdirs; add the byte-equal copies

This task closes a real gap: the current checker only globs `skills/_shared/*.md` and `skills/*/references/*.md` (flat), so a copy under `references/sme/` would never be drift-checked. We generalize it to recurse with path-relative keying (backward-compatible with the existing flat copies), then add the six copies.

**Files:**
- Modify: `scripts/check_shared_copies.py` (the `check()` function, lines 17-25)
- Create: `skills/karta-plan/references/sme/{angular,python-fastapi}.md`
- Create: `skills/karta-build/references/sme/{angular,python-fastapi}.md`
- Create: `skills/karta-verify/references/sme/{angular,python-fastapi}.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the two `_shared/sme/*.md` packs from Task 1.
- Produces: `check()` keyed by path relative to `_shared` (e.g. `sme/angular.md`), recursing both sides; six byte-equal reference copies.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the six byte-equal copies**

```bash
for skill in karta-plan karta-build karta-verify; do
  mkdir -p "skills/$skill/references/sme"
  cp skills/_shared/sme/*.md "skills/$skill/references/sme/"   # angular, python-fastapi, minimalism, platform-native
done
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Prove the gap — corrupt one copy, run the OLD checker, watch it MISS the drift**

```bash
printf '\n<!-- drift probe -->\n' >> skills/karta-plan/references/sme/angular.md
uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test
```
Expected: `SHARED COPIES: IN SYNC` — **wrong**. The flat globber never looks inside `references/sme/`, so it cannot see the drift. This is the gap this task closes.

- [ ] **Step 3: Rewrite `check()` to recurse with path-relative keying**

Replace the `check()` function (currently lines 17-25) entirely:

```python
def check() -> list[str]:
    errors: list[str] = []
    shared = {p.relative_to(SHARED).as_posix(): p.read_text()
              for p in SHARED.rglob("*.md")}
    for skill_dir in sorted(p for p in (ROOT / "skills").iterdir() if p.is_dir()):
        if skill_dir.name == "_shared":
            continue
        refs = skill_dir / "references"
        if not refs.is_dir():
            continue
        for ref in refs.rglob("*.md"):
            rel = ref.relative_to(refs).as_posix()
            if rel in shared and ref.read_text() != shared[rel]:
                errors.append(f"{ref.relative_to(ROOT)} drifted from skills/_shared/{rel}")
    return errors
```

(Backward-compatible: a flat `_shared/foo.md` keys as `foo.md`, exactly as before; the matching reference `skills/*/references/foo.md` keys as `foo.md` too.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the NEW checker — it now CATCHES the drift**

Run: `uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test`
Expected: `SHARED COPIES: DRIFT` listing `skills/karta-plan/references/sme/angular.md drifted from skills/_shared/sme/angular.md`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Fix the corrupted copy and confirm green**

```bash
cp skills/_shared/sme/angular.md skills/karta-plan/references/sme/angular.md
uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test
```
Expected: `SHARED COPIES: IN SYNC`

- [ ] **Step 6: Regenerate Codex projections (the new `references/sme/` dirs must travel) and verify**

Run:
```bash
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
```
Expected: the write run reports files written; `--check` prints `CODEX SKILLS PROJECTIONS: IN SYNC`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit (canonical + generated together)**

```bash
git add scripts/check_shared_copies.py skills/*/references/sme/ .agents/ plugins/
git commit -m "feat(sme): drift-check nested _shared subdirs; add sme reference copies"
```

---

### Task 3: Add the `sme` binder field — schema, reference, validator self-test

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-schema.json` (top-level `properties`, after `design_facts`)
- Modify: `skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py` (`_run_self_test`, before `cases = [`)
- Modify: `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-reference.md` (binder-level field table)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: an optional top-level binder field `sme`: an array of kebab-case strings. `validate_binder()` accepts it; `additionalProperties: false` would otherwise reject it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the failing self-test cases first**

In `skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py`, find the line `    cases = [` (followed by `        ("valid example", valid, True),`) inside `_run_self_test()` and insert the three fixtures plus three case rows immediately before/within it. Replace:

```python
    cases = [
        ("valid example", valid, True),
```

with:

```python
    sme_valid = {
        "slug": "sme-ok", "motivation": "x", "scope": {"included": ["x"]},
        "sme": ["angular", "python-fastapi"],
        "work_items": [{"id": "a", "title": "A", "oracle": _u}],
    }
    sme_not_array = {
        "slug": "sme-bad", "motivation": "x", "scope": {"included": ["x"]},
        "sme": "angular",
        "work_items": [{"id": "a", "title": "A", "oracle": _u}],
    }
    sme_bad_id = {
        "slug": "sme-badid", "motivation": "x", "scope": {"included": ["x"]},
        "sme": ["Angular_Expert"],
        "work_items": [{"id": "a", "title": "A", "oracle": _u}],
    }
    cases = [
        ("valid example", valid, True),
        ("binder with sme packs", sme_valid, True),
        ("sme not an array", sme_not_array, False),
        ("sme id bad pattern", sme_bad_id, False),
```

(`_u = {"type": "unit"}` is already defined earlier in the function and is in scope here.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the self-test — the new VALID case FAILS**

Run: `uv run skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py --self-test`
Expected: a `[FAIL] binder with sme packs` line — the schema's `additionalProperties: false` rejects the unknown `sme` property, so the "should be valid" case is reported invalid. Overall exit non-zero.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add `sme` to the schema**

In `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-schema.json`, replace:

```json
        "stack": { "type": "string", "description": "resolved stack, recorded once" }
      }
    },
    "token_manifest": {
```

with:

```json
        "stack": { "type": "string", "description": "resolved stack, recorded once" }
      }
    },
    "sme": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*$" },
      "description": "ids of advisory SME packs auto-matched at plan time; the Review checklist of each is the enforceable subset the safety-auditor judges (project-local .karta/sme/<id>.md overrides the built-in references/sme/<id>.md)"
    },
    "token_manifest": {
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the self-test — all cases PASS**

Run: `uv run skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py --self-test`
Expected: every line `[PASS]`, final line `16/16 checks passed` (12 prior + 3 new + the opt-out check), exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: Document the field in `binder-reference.md`**

In `skills/karta-plan/references/binder-reference.md`, replace:

```
| `design_facts.stack` | string | no | Resolved tech stack, recorded once at plan time |
```

with:

```
| `design_facts.stack` | string | no | Resolved tech stack, recorded once at plan time |
| `sme` | string[] | no | Ids of advisory SME packs matched at plan time; the implementer writes against them and `karta-safety-auditor` enforces each pack's Review checklist (undeclared violations only). Absent or `[]` = none |
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Regenerate projections (binder-schema/reference/validator live under the karta-plan skill) and verify all checks**

Run:
```bash
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py
uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
uv run scripts/validate_plugin.py --self-test

git commit -m "feat(sme): add optional sme[] binder field (schema, reference, validator)"
```

### Task 4: karta-plan — match packs, feed synthesis, pin, report

All edits are to `skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md`. The matcher is prose the planner follows (no script). Each edit is an exact anchored replacement.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the resolved stack/deps from `plan:survey`; the packs under `references/sme/` + `.karta/sme/`.
- Produces: the binder's `sme[]` (matched ids), and SME do's/don'ts threaded into the synthesis brief.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the SME config row**

Replace:
```
| **Repo policy** | CI/branch/deployment policy (only when in planning scope) | Read root/area `AGENTS.md`, workflows, and CI docs; load [references/ci-policy.md](references/ci-policy.md) and [references/policy-yagni.md](references/policy-yagni.md) |
```
with:
```
| **Repo policy** | CI/branch/deployment policy (only when in planning scope) | Read root/area `AGENTS.md`, workflows, and CI docs; load [references/ci-policy.md](references/ci-policy.md) and [references/policy-yagni.md](references/policy-yagni.md) |
| **SME packs** | Advisory domain-expert do's/don'ts to apply (each with an enforceable Review checklist) | Match the built-in [references/sme/](references/sme/) plus the project overlay `.karta/sme/*.md` against the detected deps/stack; record matched ids in the binder's `sme` |
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the matcher subsection at the end of Phase 1**

Replace:
```
Non-UI stacks skip this annex entirely — the base survey above is all they need.

---

### Phase 2 — Synthesize the binder (synthesis subagent; main thread owns judgment)  `plan:synthesize`
```
with:
```
Non-UI stacks skip this annex entirely — the base survey above is all they need.

**SME expert matching (after the survey)  `plan:sme`.** karta ships curated SME packs — advisory do's/don'ts per stack, each with an enforceable Review checklist — and a project may add its own. Once the survey resolves the stack and dependencies, select the packs that apply:

1. Enumerate available packs by `name`: the project overlay `.karta/sme/*.md` in the repo, laid over the built-ins in [references/sme/](references/sme/). On a name clash the project-local file wins. (`platform-native.md` is shared reference data, not a pack — skip it; the packs link to it via `see_also`.)
2. Select the packs that apply, by frontmatter kind:
   - A **rule pack** (`always: true`, e.g. `minimalism`) applies to **every** binder, unconditionally.
   - A **stack pack** (`match: [tokens]`) applies when a token equals a detected dependency name or is a case-insensitive substring of the resolved stack phrase.
3. Collect the applied pack `name`s — rule and stack together — into the binder's `sme`. Every binder gets at least the rule packs (e.g. `["minimalism"]`); a polyglot repo adds several stack packs (e.g. `["minimalism", "python-fastapi", "angular"]`). A project that wants no rule pack overrides it with a no-op `.karta/sme/<name>.md`.

Load the applied packs now — their guidance feeds synthesis (Phase 2) and their ids are pinned into the binder (Phase 5). These packs are **advisory for decomposition**: they shape how items are split, what each `contract` says, and which `oracle` assertions you choose; they never add a gate at plan time.

---

### Phase 2 — Synthesize the binder (synthesis subagent; main thread owns judgment)  `plan:synthesize`
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the domain-guidance paragraph to the synthesis brief**

Replace:
```
Given the intent `<intent>` and the repo survey (`plan:survey`), draft a binder JSON that conforms to [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md).
```
with:
```
Given the intent `<intent>` and the repo survey (`plan:survey`), draft a binder JSON that conforms to [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md).

**Domain guidance (when SME packs matched in `plan:sme`).** When one or more SME packs matched, their do's/don'ts are domain guidance for this synthesis. Decompose items, write `contract`s, and choose `oracle` assertions so they respect each matched stack's patterns and avoid its anti-patterns (e.g. an Angular slice's `contract` speaks in standalone-component / signals terms; a FastAPI item's `oracle` expects Pydantic-validated request/response shapes). This guidance shapes the plan; it never adds a plan-time gate.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add `sme` to the binder-level populate list**

Replace:
```
- `token_manifest` only when the stack has a token system
```
with:
```
- `token_manifest` only when the stack has a token system
- `sme` — the SME pack ids matched in `plan:sme`; omit or use `[]` when none matched
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add `sme` to the post-synthesis review checklist**

Replace:
```
- UI fields are present only on items with a UI surface.

Fix gaps in the main thread before proceeding.
```
with:
```
- UI fields are present only on items with a UI surface.
- `sme` lists the packs matched in `plan:sme` (or is absent / `[]` when none matched).

Fix gaps in the main thread before proceeding.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the report line to Phase 6**

Replace:
```
- **First wave** — the items with no `depends_on`. These can start right away.
```
with:
```
- **First wave** — the items with no `depends_on`. These can start right away.
- **Experts applied** — the `sme` packs in effect for this binder (or *none*).
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Verify the insertions and regenerate**

Run:
```bash
grep -c "plan:sme" skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md          # expect 4 (matcher header + guidance + populate + review)
grep -q "SME expert matching" skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md && echo matcher-ok
grep -q "Experts applied" skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md && echo report-ok
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py && uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
```
Expected: `3`, `matcher-ok`, `report-ok`, `CODEX SKILLS PROJECTIONS: IN SYNC`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/karta-plan/SKILL.md .agents/ plugins/
git commit -m "feat(sme): karta-plan matches packs, feeds synthesis, pins sme[]"
```

---

### Task 5: karta-build — load packs, self-check the diff, record declared overrides

All edits are to `skills/karta-build/SKILL.md`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `skills/karta-build/SKILL.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the binder's `sme[]`; packs under `references/sme/` + `.karta/sme/`; the `KARTA-DEFER` marker convention in `references/declared-debt.md`.
- Produces: `SME_PACKS` cached in `build:gate`; packs loaded in `build:implement`; a pre-commit self-check in `build:merge` that emits `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <reason>` markers for deliberate deviations and a per-pack result line in `build:report`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Cache `SME_PACKS` in `build:gate`**

Replace:
```
- UI annex fields, **only if present**: `COMPONENT_MAP` (`component_map`), `ICON_MAP` (`icon_map`), `TOKEN_CHANGES` (`token_changes`), `DESIGN_REFERENCE` (`design_reference`), and the binder's `design_facts.source`
```
with:
```
- UI annex fields, **only if present**: `COMPONENT_MAP` (`component_map`), `ICON_MAP` (`icon_map`), `TOKEN_CHANGES` (`token_changes`), `DESIGN_REFERENCE` (`design_reference`), and the binder's `design_facts.source`
- `SME_PACKS` — the binder's `sme` list (advisory expert pack ids), if present; resolved and loaded in `build:implement`, self-checked in `build:merge`
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the SME config row to build's Project configuration table**

Replace:
```
| **Repo policy** | Branch/CI/ruleset/deployment policy, only when the item touches those areas | Read root/area `AGENTS.md`, existing workflows, CI docs when remote policy is in scope. For details load [references/ci-policy.md](references/ci-policy.md) and [references/policy-yagni.md](references/policy-yagni.md) |
```
with:
```
| **Repo policy** | Branch/CI/ruleset/deployment policy, only when the item touches those areas | Read root/area `AGENTS.md`, existing workflows, CI docs when remote policy is in scope. For details load [references/ci-policy.md](references/ci-policy.md) and [references/policy-yagni.md](references/policy-yagni.md) |
| **SME packs** | Advisory expert do's/don'ts to write against, with an enforceable Review checklist | Read the binder's `sme`; resolve each id against the project overlay `.karta/sme/*.md` laid over the built-in [references/sme/](references/sme/) |
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Load the packs in `build:implement` (new step 4c-ter)**

Replace:
```
**4c-bis. Build the token manifest (UI + DTCG token systems only).** When the item carries a UI surface and the project has a DTCG/tiered token system, build the token manifest before any token lookup — see **[references/dtcg-tokens.md](references/dtcg-tokens.md)**. Skip entirely otherwise.

**4d. Implement the item** against the resolved conventions, stack-agnostically. Key rules:
```
with:
```
**4c-bis. Build the token manifest (UI + DTCG token systems only).** When the item carries a UI surface and the project has a DTCG/tiered token system, build the token manifest before any token lookup — see **[references/dtcg-tokens.md](references/dtcg-tokens.md)**. Skip entirely otherwise.

**4c-ter. Load the SME packs (when `SME_PACKS` is non-empty).** For each id in `SME_PACKS`, resolve the pack file — the project overlay `.karta/sme/<id>.md` in the worktree, else the built-in [references/sme/](references/sme/) `<id>.md`. Read each resolved pack and hold its **Do / Don't / Patterns / Review checklist** as implementation guidance for this item; in a polyglot repo apply the pack(s) matching the area this item targets. If a pinned id resolves to no file, record a one-line non-fatal note for the report (`build:report`) and continue — advisory guidance never blocks. Follow this guidance while implementing (4d) and while fixing any gate kickback.

**4d. Implement the item** against the resolved conventions, stack-agnostically. Key rules:
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Add the pre-commit self-check to `build:merge` (new step 9-sme, before 9a)**

Replace:
```
The integration tip has exactly one writer per [references/integration-branch.md](references/integration-branch.md). Steps 9a (secret scan) and 9b (commit) run in **both** modes; step 9c branches on `RUN_MODE`.

**9a. Secret scan before every commit.**
```
with:
```
The integration tip has exactly one writer per [references/integration-branch.md](references/integration-branch.md). Steps 9a (secret scan) and 9b (commit) run in **both** modes; step 9c branches on `RUN_MODE`.

**9-sme. SME self-check before commit (when `SME_PACKS` is non-empty).** For each loaded pack (4c-ter), run its **Review checklist** against the item's diff (`git diff "$integration"...HEAD`). For every checklist item, decide pass or miss. Two outcomes for a miss:

- **Fix it** — adjust the code so the checklist item passes. Preferred.
- **Declare the override** — when the deviation is deliberate and justified, leave the code and record a declared override at the deviation site, modelled on the `KARTA-DEFER` family (see [references/declared-debt.md](references/declared-debt.md)): an inline comment `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <checklist-rule>): <one-line rationale> [ceiling: <where it breaks>; upgrade: <what forces a revisit>]`. The `ceiling`/`upgrade` trigger is **optional** — name it when the shortcut is knowingly temporary; a permanent justified exception needs only the rationale. A declared override is a justified crossing; the safety-auditor passes it.

Record the per-pack tally for the report (`build:report`), e.g. `SME self-check (angular): 4/4 ok` or `3/4 — 1 declared override`. This self-check **never halts the build** — it produces the markers and the report line. The judgment of declared-vs-undeclared belongs to `karta-safety-auditor` at the gate: an **undeclared** checklist violation is a VIOLATION there (kickback), so leaving a miss neither fixed nor declared will fail the boundary scan. Only Review-checklist items have teeth; Do / Don't / Patterns are advisory.

**9a. Secret scan before every commit.**
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Add the SME report bullet to `build:report`**

Replace:
```
- **Acceptance result** — which gate ran (`karta-verify` / `karta-validate` / opted out), final disposition, rounds used, any residual finding
```
with:
```
- **Acceptance result** — which gate ran (`karta-verify` / `karta-validate` / opted out), final disposition, rounds used, any residual finding
- **SME self-check** — per applied pack, the Review-checklist tally and any `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` declared (what, which rule, why); plus a note for any pinned `sme` id that resolved to no pack file. Omit the whole line when `SME_PACKS` is empty
```

- [ ] **Step 5b: Flag no-trigger deferrals in the debt register (the rot flag)**

The rot flag (borrowed from ponytail-debt) lives in the **existing** debt register — no new system, no backlog. In `skills/karta-build/SKILL.md`, find the `build:report` bullet that begins `- **Declared-debt summary** — every `KARTA-DEFER` marker you placed (what, why, external follow-up), per [references/declared-debt.md](references/declared-debt.md).` and, immediately after that `declared-debt.md` reference, insert this sentence (keep the rest of the bullet unchanged):

```
 **Flag any `KARTA-DEFER` marker whose `follow-up:` trigger is missing or empty as `no-trigger`** — the deferral that silently rots — and end the register with `<N> markers, <M> no-trigger`. This reads what you already scanned; it adds no state.
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Verify the insertions and regenerate**

Run:
```bash
grep -q "4c-ter" skills/karta-build/SKILL.md && echo load-ok
grep -q "9-sme" skills/karta-build/SKILL.md && echo selfcheck-ok
grep -q "KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE" skills/karta-build/SKILL.md && echo marker-ok
grep -q "ceiling: <where it breaks>" skills/karta-build/SKILL.md && echo ceiling-ok
grep -q "no-trigger" skills/karta-build/SKILL.md && echo rotflag-ok
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py && uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
```
Expected: `load-ok`, `selfcheck-ok`, `marker-ok`, `CODEX SKILLS PROJECTIONS: IN SYNC`.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/karta-build/SKILL.md .agents/ plugins/
git commit -m "feat(sme): karta-build loads packs, self-checks diff, records overrides"
```

### Task 6: Safety-auditor enforces undeclared overrides; karta-verify resolves checklists

**Files:**
- Modify: `agents/karta-safety-auditor.md` (canonical agent)
- Modify: `skills/karta-verify/SKILL.md`
- Regenerate: `.codex/agents/karta-safety-auditor.toml`, `skills/karta-verify/references/karta-safety-auditor.agent.md` (via `sync_codex_agents.py`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the binder's `sme[]`; the packs' Review checklists (resolved by karta-verify); the `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` markers from Task 5.
- Produces: a conditional auditor check — `PASS` when no `sme[]` or all checklist violations are declared; `VIOLATION` on any undeclared checklist violation (existing kickback + 3-attempt-then-escalate machinery).

- [ ] **Step 1: Update the auditor's `description` frontmatter**

In `agents/karta-safety-auditor.md`, replace:
```
description: Read-only boundary scan on the actual diff. Re-runs the seven smart-surfaced-review signals against the real code and flags any sensitive, destructive, or contract crossing the work item never justified; verdict PASS | VIOLATION; max 3 attempts then escalate to the human.
```
with:
```
description: Read-only boundary scan on the actual diff. Re-runs the seven smart-surfaced-review signals against the real code, plus a conditional SME-norm conformance check when the binder pins sme[], and flags any sensitive, destructive, contract, or undeclared SME-checklist crossing the work item never justified; verdict PASS | VIOLATION; max 3 attempts then escalate to the human.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add the conditional checklist input**

Replace:
```
3. **The diff range** — the item branch versus the integration tip. Run `git diff <range>` in the shell to see exactly what changed. You scan the diff, not the whole tree.

Read the binder JSON directly. There is no invariants registry, no resolver, no stored rule state, and no per-repo placeholder rule to fail closed on. The rule set is the seven signals below — they are always configured because they are embedded here.
```
with:
```
3. **The diff range** — the item branch versus the integration tip. Run `git diff <range>` in the shell to see exactly what changed. You scan the diff, not the whole tree.
4. **SME Review checklists (conditional).** Only when the binder's `sme[]` is non-empty, the dispatcher hands you the resolved **Review checklist** of each pinned pack (the built-in and project-local packs cannot be re-derived by you — built-ins live in the plugin, not the worktree — so they travel in your dispatch). When `sme[]` is empty or absent you receive none and skip the SME-norm check below entirely.

Read the binder JSON directly. There is no invariants registry, no resolver, no stored rule state, and no per-repo placeholder rule to fail closed on. The base rule set is the seven signals below — always configured because they are embedded here; the SME-norm check is the one conditional addition, and only when checklists were handed to you.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the conditional SME-norm check after the seven signals**

Replace:
```
A leaked secret in the diff is a leaked secret in production; treat sensitive-zone findings with that seriousness.

## How to scan
```
with:
```
A leaked secret in the diff is a leaked secret in production; treat sensitive-zone findings with that seriousness.

## Conditional check — SME-norm conformance (only when checklists were handed to you)

When the dispatcher handed you SME Review checklists (input 4), judge the diff against **those checklist items only** — never the packs' Do / Don't / Patterns prose, which is advisory. For each checklist item, scan the diff for a violation. A violation is a finding **unless it is declared**: the implementer may justify a deliberate deviation with an inline `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <rationale>` marker at the deviation site (the same declared-crossing principle as the seven signals — a declared crossing is justified). So:

- Diff violates a checklist item **and carries no matching `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` marker** → **VIOLATION** (undeclared override).
- Diff violates a checklist item **and a matching marker declares it** → justified; pass it.
- No checklist violation → pass.

This check uses the same verdict, cap, and escalation path as the seven signals; an undeclared SME override is just one more boundary crossing. The acceptance-reviewer does not see this — it is yours alone.

## How to scan
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Note the conditional in the rules list**

Replace:
```
- **The seven signals are the rule set.** They are embedded above; there is no per-repo placeholder rule and no fail-closed-on-unconfigured mechanism. The signals are always present.
```
with:
```
- **The seven signals are the base rule set.** They are embedded above; there is no per-repo placeholder rule and no fail-closed-on-unconfigured mechanism. The signals are always present. The SME-norm check is the one conditional addition — active only when the binder pins `sme[]` and the dispatcher handed you the checklists; it judges checklist items only, and a declared `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` marker passes.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Teach karta-verify to resolve and pass the checklists**

In `skills/karta-verify/SKILL.md`, replace:
```
The agent re-runs the seven smart-surfaced-review signals (see `references/smart-surfaced-review.md`) on the actual diff and returns:
```
with:
```
**Resolve SME checklists first (only when the binder pins `sme[]`).** Read the binder's `sme` list. For each id, resolve the pack — the worktree's project overlay `.karta/sme/<id>.md` laid over this skill's built-in [references/sme/](references/sme/) `<id>.md` (project-local wins) — and extract its **Review checklist** section. Hand those checklists to the auditor in its dispatch brief. This is the one input beyond the four that travels to a gate agent, and only when `sme[]` is non-empty: a project-extensible checklist cannot be embedded in the self-contained agent, and built-in packs live in the plugin rather than the worktree, so the dispatcher resolves them. When `sme[]` is empty or absent, hand nothing and the auditor's SME-norm check no-ops.

The agent re-runs the seven smart-surfaced-review signals (see `references/smart-surfaced-review.md`) on the actual diff — plus, when handed SME checklists, the conditional SME-norm check (an undeclared `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` is a VIOLATION) — and returns:
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Soften the "only four inputs" lines in karta-verify to admit the scoped exception**

Replace (in Phase 0):
```
1. Confirm a fresh, thin context: only the worktree path, the binder path, the work item id, and the diff range travel to each agent. No build-session state.
```
with:
```
1. Confirm a fresh, thin context: only the worktree path, the binder path, the work item id, and the diff range travel to each agent — plus, for the safety-auditor when the binder pins `sme[]`, the resolved SME Review checklists (see `verify:boundary`). No build-session state.
```

Replace (in the Gotchas):
```
- **Fresh session per dispatch.** Each agent dispatch is a new session with no build-session context. Pass only the four inputs; nothing else travels.
```
with:
```
- **Fresh session per dispatch.** Each agent dispatch is a new session with no build-session context. Pass only the four inputs — the one exception is the safety-auditor's SME Review checklists, resolved here and passed only when the binder pins `sme[]`. No build-session state travels.
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Regenerate the agent projections, then the skill projections, and verify**

Order matters: the bundled `*.agent.md` lives inside the karta-verify skill, so agents-sync runs before skills-sync (per AGENTS.md "After you edit").
```bash
uv run scripts/sync_codex_agents.py
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py
uv run scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --check
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
```
Expected: both `--check`s report IN SYNC. Confirm the generated bundle carries the new check:
```bash
grep -q "SME-norm conformance" skills/karta-verify/references/karta-safety-auditor.agent.md && echo bundle-ok
grep -q "SME-norm conformance" .codex/agents/karta-safety-auditor.toml && echo toml-ok
```
Expected: `bundle-ok`, `toml-ok`.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit (canonical agent + verify skill + all regenerated projections)**

```bash
git add agents/karta-safety-auditor.md skills/karta-verify/ .codex/ .agents/ plugins/
git commit -m "feat(sme): safety-auditor flags undeclared overrides; karta-verify passes checklists"
```

### Task 7: New read-only `karta-debt` harvest skill

**Files:**
- Create: `skills/karta-debt/SKILL.md`
- Modify: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (register the skill)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `KARTA-DEFER` and `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>)` marker families (Tasks 5).
- Produces: a one-shot, read-only repo-wide ledger of both marker families, grouped by file, flagging `no-trigger` rows. Writes nothing, tracks nothing — consistent with karta's no-backlog rule.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write `skills/karta-debt/SKILL.md`**

```markdown
---
name: karta-debt
description: >-
  Harvest every KARTA-DEFER and KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE marker in the repo into a one-shot, read-only ledger so deliberate shortcuts and overrides don't rot into "later means never". Groups by file, flags markers with no upgrade trigger. Writes nothing, tracks nothing. Trigger phrases: "karta debt", "list the shortcuts", "what did we defer", "harvest the overrides".
---

karta-debt collects karta's inline deferral and override markers into one ledger so a deferral can't quietly become permanent. It is **read-only**: it reads and reports, and changes nothing — consistent with karta's no-backlog rule (the ledger is a report handed to you once, not a list karta persists, schedules, or revisits).

## Two marker families

- `KARTA-DEFER(<id>): <what> — <why> — follow-up: <trigger>` — an inline build-time deferral (see karta-build's `references/declared-debt.md`).
- `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <rationale> [ceiling: <limit>; upgrade: <trigger>]` — a deliberate deviation from an SME pack's Review checklist (see karta-build, `build:merge`).

## Scan

Grep the repo for both markers, skipping VCS / build / vendor output:

`grep -rnE 'KARTA-DEFER|KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE' . --exclude-dir={.git,node_modules,dist,build,.venv}`

Each hit is one ledger row. The marker prefix keeps prose that merely mentions the convention out of the ledger.

## Output

One row per marker, grouped by file:

`<file>:<line>  <family>  <what>.  trigger: <upgrade / follow-up, or "none">.`

Pull the trigger straight from the marker — `follow-up:` for a `KARTA-DEFER`, `upgrade:` for an override. Flag any marker with no trigger as `no-trigger` — those silently rot. A `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE` whose rationale states it is a permanent exception is expected; tag it `permanent`, not `no-trigger`.

End with `<N> markers, <M> no-trigger`. Nothing found: `No karta debt markers. Clean ledger.`

## Boundaries

Reads and reports only — changes nothing, persists nothing, schedules nothing. One-shot. If you want it saved, that is your copy to keep; karta does not write or track a ledger file. This skill never edits code, tests, or the binder. Write the report in plain language (the karta-plainlanguage standard).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Register the skill in the Claude marketplace manifest**

In `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, replace:
```
        "./skills/karta-doc-gardner"
```
with:
```
        "./skills/karta-doc-gardner",
        "./skills/karta-debt"
```
(The Codex projections auto-discover every `skills/*/SKILL.md`, so no Codex-manifest edit is needed — the sync scripts mirror the new skill.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Regenerate projections and verify**

Run:
```bash
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
uv run scripts/validate_plugin.py --self-test
test -f .agents/skills/karta-debt/SKILL.md && echo mirror-ok
```
Expected: `CODEX SKILLS PROJECTIONS: IN SYNC`, plugin self-test passes, `mirror-ok`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add skills/karta-debt/ .claude-plugin/marketplace.json .agents/ plugins/
git commit -m "feat(sme): add read-only karta-debt marker-harvest skill"
```

### Task 8: `benchmarks/sme/` — prove a pack helps

A lean A/B method to measure a pack's effect, modelled on ponytail's agentic benchmark, with ponytail-gain's honesty rule: report the A/B delta on a benchmark task, never a per-repo "you saved X" number.

**Files:**
- Create: `benchmarks/sme/README.md`
- Create: `benchmarks/sme/fixtures/date-picker.md`
- Create: `benchmarks/sme/run.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: two unified-diff files (one built with the pack pinned, one with `sme: []`).
- Produces: a printed A/B comparison of added LOC and new dependencies, plus a documented protocol for the gate-pass (safety) axis.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the runner `benchmarks/sme/run.py`**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Measure an SME pack's effect: compare an A (pack applied) vs B (pack absent) diff.

Honesty rule (from ponytail-gain): report the A/B delta on a benchmark task, never a

- [ ] **Step 2: Write a fixture task `benchmarks/sme/fixtures/date-picker.md`**

```markdown
# Fixture: date picker

**Task:** Add a date-of-birth field to the signup form that lets the user pick a date.

**Why this fixture:** the classic over-build trap — an agent may install a date-picker library and wrap it, where the platform ships `<input type="date">`. The `minimalism` pack's "no dependency where the platform covers it" checklist item should bite here.

**Run both arms:** build this task once with the binder pinning `minimalism` (and the stack pack), once with `sme: []`. Capture each `git diff` against the integration tip.
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write `benchmarks/sme/README.md` (the protocol + honesty rule)**

```markdown
# SME pack benchmarks

Measure whether an SME pack earns its place: run the same fixture task **with the pack** and **without it**, then compare.

## Protocol (per fixture)

1. Pick a fixture under `fixtures/`.
2. **Arm A (pack on):** plan + build the fixture with the binder pinning the pack(s). Save the build's `git diff <integration>...HEAD` to `a.diff`.
3. **Arm B (pack off):** repeat with the binder's `sme: []`. Save to `b.diff`.
4. Compare: `python run.py --with a.diff --without b.diff --label date-picker`.
5. **Safety axis:** run the fixture's acceptance gate (`karta-verify`) on both arms and record pass/fail. A pack must not cut correctness to cut code — if Arm A is smaller but fails the gate, the pack lost.
6. Repeat for a small `n` and report medians.

## Honesty rule (from ponytail-gain)

Report only the **A/B delta on these fixtures**. Never print a per-repo "you saved X lines/tokens here" number: in a live repo the unbuilt version was never written, so there is no real baseline to subtract from. The only honest per-repo figure is the `karta-debt` ledger (a counted list of real markers).

## Automation note

Full push-button automation depends on a headless build path. Today the runner (`run.py`) compares two captured diffs; capturing them is the manual part of the protocol above.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Smoke-test the runner**

```bash
printf '+a\n+b\n+++ x\n' > /tmp/a.diff
printf '+a\n' > /tmp/b.diff
python benchmarks/sme/run.py --with /tmp/a.diff --without /tmp/b.diff --label smoke
```
Expected: a table showing `added LOC with pack: 2 without: 1 delta: +1` and the honesty-note line. (Here "with pack" is larger only because it's a synthetic input; real fixtures expect the delta negative.)

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add benchmarks/sme/
git commit -m "feat(sme): benchmarks/sme — A/B pack-effectiveness method + runner"
```

### Task 9: Docs + full validation pass

**Files:**
- Modify: `AGENTS.md` (layout table)
- Modify: `README.md` (new SME section)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything above. No new code.
- Produces: contributor + user docs; a clean four-check run.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add the `_shared/sme` row to the AGENTS.md layout table**

In `AGENTS.md`, replace:
```
| `skills/_shared/<f>.md` | Shared reference text — canonical | yes |
```
with:
```
| `skills/_shared/<f>.md` | Shared reference text — canonical | yes |
| `skills/_shared/sme/<id>.md` | Built-in SME packs — stack (`match`) + rule (`always: true`); canonical, copied byte-equal into karta-plan/build/verify `references/sme/` | yes |
| `skills/_shared/sme/platform-native.md` | Shared reference data (ponytail-attributed) the packs link to via `see_also` — not a pack | yes |
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Add a short SME section to the README**

In `README.md`, replace:
```
## Cross-cutting
```
with:
```
## Domain experts (SME packs)

karta carries curated **SME packs** so planning and implementation follow good norms. There are two kinds:

- **Stack packs** switch on when your project uses that tech — built-ins ship for `angular` and `python-fastapi`.
- **Rule packs** apply to every project — the built-in `minimalism` pack distils ponytail's ladder (write the least code that works; reach for the stdlib and the platform before a dependency) at its "full" level.

At plan time karta applies the rule packs plus any stack packs that match the repo, and pins their ids in the binder's `sme` field; karta-build loads them to write against. ponytail's "use the platform" tables ship as a shared `platform-native` reference the packs link to. A project adds or overrides any pack — stack or rule — by dropping `.karta/sme/<id>.md` in its repo (project-local wins on a name clash); a no-op file silences a built-in rule pack.

Each pack's **Review checklist** is the enforceable part (checklist items are diff-checkable; the advisory do's/don'ts and the ladder never block). Before commit the build implementer self-checks its diff; a deliberate deviation is declared inline with a `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <reason>` marker, optionally naming where the shortcut breaks and what forces a revisit. The existing `karta-safety-auditor` then flags any **undeclared** checklist violation as a boundary crossing the item never justified — a kickback, escalating to you at its cap. A declared override passes and is surfaced in the run report. The acceptance gate stays SME-unaware: exactly one acceptance authority.

Two companions: **`/karta-debt`** harvests every deferral and override marker across the repo into a one-shot, read-only ledger (it flags any shortcut with no upgrade trigger, and writes nothing — karta keeps no backlog), and **`benchmarks/sme/`** is an A/B method to check a pack actually helps (same task with and without the pack: less code, gate still green), reporting only benchmark deltas, never an invented per-repo savings figure.

## Cross-cutting
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Regenerate (README/AGENTS are not mirrored, but run the skills sync for safety) and run all four pre-commit checks**

Run:
```bash
uv run scripts/sync_codex_agents.py --check
uv run scripts/sync_codex_skills.py --check
uv run scripts/check_shared_copies.py --self-test
uv run scripts/validate_plugin.py --self-test
uv run skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py --self-test
```
Expected: `IN SYNC`, `IN SYNC`, `SHARED COPIES: IN SYNC`, plugin self-test passes, validator `16/16 checks passed`.

- [ ] **Step 4: End-to-end smoke — a binder that pins `sme[]` validates**

```bash
cat > /tmp/sme-smoke.json <<'JSON'
{ "slug": "sme-smoke", "motivation": "smoke", "scope": { "included": ["x"] },
  "design_facts": { "stack": "Python/FastAPI + Angular SPA" },
  "sme": ["minimalism", "python-fastapi", "angular"],
  "env_contract": { "command": "uv run uvicorn app:app", "supports_isolation": true },
  "work_items": [ { "id": "wi01", "title": "Endpoint", "oracle": { "type": "unit" } } ] }
JSON
uv run skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py --binder /tmp/sme-smoke.json
```
Expected: `VALID. 1 work items; 0 opted out of acceptance checks.`

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add AGENTS.md README.md
git commit -m "docs(sme): document SME packs in README and AGENTS layout"
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Final review of the whole branch**

```bash
git log --oneline main..HEAD
git diff --stat main..HEAD
```
Expected: the nine feature commits (Tasks 1-9) plus the spec commits, touching only the files named in this plan and their regenerated projections.

## Self-Review

**Spec coverage (v2):**
- Pack format + built-ins, incl. the `minimalism` rule pack and the shared `platform-native` reference (spec 3a, 3b, 3g) → Task 1.
- Project overlay + byte-equal copies (all `_shared/sme/*.md`) + nested drift check (spec 3b, 4) → Task 2.
- `sme` field, schema, validator (spec 3c, 3f, 4) → Task 3.
- Plan match (rule packs always-apply + stack packs by match) + guidance + pin + report (spec 3c, 3d) → Task 4.
- Build load + self-check + override markers with optional ceiling/upgrade + no-trigger rot flag in the debt register (spec 3e, 3h) → Task 5.
- Safety-auditor conditional enforcement + karta-verify checklist resolution (spec 3f) → Task 6.
- `karta-debt` read-only harvest skill (spec 3h) → Task 7.
- `benchmarks/sme/` A/B method + runner + honesty rule (spec 3i) → Task 8.
- Wiring/docs (spec 4) → regeneration folded into each touching task; docs in Task 9.
- Non-goals (spec 5): no new gate authority (auditor conditional, acceptance-reviewer untouched ✓), checklist items diff-checkable so the rule pack is enforceable without judging a vibe ✓, no intensity dial ✓, no tracked backlog (rot flag + karta-debt are read-only/one-shot ✓), no per-item override ✓.

**Placeholder scan:** every code step shows full content; every command shows expected output. No TBD/TODO.

**Type/name consistency:** field `sme` (array of kebab-case strings, holds stack + rule pack ids); pack ids `angular`, `python-fastapi`, `minimalism`; selection `match` (stack) vs `always: true` (rule); shared reference `platform-native.md`; cache var `SME_PACKS`; phase label `plan:sme`; build steps `4c-ter` / `9-sme`; marker `KARTA-SME-OVERRIDE(<pack>: <rule>): <reason> [ceiling: …; upgrade: …]` — used identically across Tasks 3-9. The auditor receives checklists as a conditional 4th input; karta-verify is the sole resolver/dispatcher; `karta-debt` dispatches nothing.

## Execution Handoff

Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/2026-06-21-sme-domain-experts.md`. Two execution options:

1. **Subagent-Driven (recommended)** — a fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration.
2. **Inline Execution** — execute tasks in this session with checkpoints for review.

Which approach?
