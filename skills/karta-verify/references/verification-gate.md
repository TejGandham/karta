# Verification Gate

After a work item is built, karta checks it before it counts as done. The check is a gate, not a suggestion. This file describes the gate's shape; the smart-surfaced-review reference describes the signals it re-runs, and the definition-of-done reference is the canonical source for the floor.

## Shape

The gate runs on the actual diff, in a fresh AI session, with a deliberately thin context: only the worktree, the binder, and the work item's acceptance check (its `oracle`, and `contract` if it has one). It does not inherit the build session's context, and it is independent of whoever implemented the item. The point is to judge the code that exists, not the story the implementer tells about it.

The gate is realized by dispatching two karta-owned agents — `karta-acceptance-reviewer` and `karta-safety-auditor` — plus `karta-validate` for visual oracles. Each runs read-only: it reports, it never edits.

## Three checks, all on the actual diff

1. **Acceptance.** Does the diff satisfy the oracle's assertions? Visual oracles go to `karta-validate`, which compares rendered output against the design. Unit, integration, e2e, and smoke oracles go to `karta-acceptance-reviewer`, which dispositions each assertion against the code.

2. **Contract conformance.** If the item declares a `contract`, the gate checks the diff against an external artifact — a type-checker, a schema, or a contract test — not against the binder's own claim about the contract. A binder field saying "this conforms" is not evidence; the type-checker passing is. `karta-acceptance-reviewer` owns this check.

3. **Boundary scan.** Does the diff cross a sensitive, destructive, or contract boundary the item never justified? `karta-safety-auditor` re-runs the seven smart-surfaced-review signals on the real code and flags any crossing the work item did not declare. This is the build-time pass that the smart-surfaced-review reference calls the real gate: the plan-time triage informs, this decides.

## The loop and its caps

On any finding, the gate kicks the work back to the implementer (karta-build) for bounded self-correction, then re-runs on the corrected diff. The two agents have different caps, and they are deliberately different:

- `karta-safety-auditor` — **max 3 attempts, then escalate to the human.** A boundary the item never justified is a safety question; if three rounds of self-correction cannot clear it, a person needs to look, because the invariant or the crossing itself may need a decision.
- `karta-acceptance-reviewer` — **max 2 attempts, then halt with a call to action.** No human escalation here, and **no self-clear**: on the second failed attempt the gate halts and the item takes the halt path — a `failed` ref, no `built`/`done`; it is **not done**. Declaring debt does **not** make a capped acceptance failure pass — that would let the implementer grade its own escape. The only ways forward are (a) **fix-and-rerun**, or (b) **re-plan the unmet assertion as an explicit oracle `opt_out` (with a reason) via karta-plan, then re-run** — the binder is read-only to build, so accepting an unmet assertion is a deliberate plan-time decision, recorded and validated like any opt-out and surfaced in the opt-out summary; karta has **no backlog**. (`KARTA-DEFER` markers are for inline build-time deferrals, never to clear this gate — see the declared-debt reference.)

There is no human review gate during delivery. The human is reached only on retry-exhaustion of the safety auditor — nowhere else.

## The floor

If the change does not even compile, type-check, or lint, the gate does not pass and karta does not auto-merge. It surfaces the item for a person instead. This is the floor under every non-opted-out item, and the definition-of-done reference is its canonical statement. A change that cannot clear compile/type-check/lint has not earned an acceptance review — it has earned a surfacing.

### When the oracle command overlaps the floor

For a check oracle, the `oracle.command` is often a superset of the floor — the floor clears compile/type-check/lint, and the command is something wider like `npm run lint && npm test`. That looks like the floor and the gate run the same command twice. They do not. The command runs and the gate inspects, and they sit at different altitudes:

- **Floor — the command runs in the worktree.** karta-build runs the project's floor commands (and the oracle command, when the project wires it in) inside the build worktree before any handoff. This is execution: the code compiles, type-checks, lints, and the command exits clean, or the item never reaches the gate.
- **Acceptance — the gate reads the diff.** The acceptance gate is read-only. `karta-acceptance-reviewer` dispositions each oracle assertion against the actual diff and, for a declared `contract`, checks the diff against the external artifact. It does not execute the oracle command. The command's runtime truth belongs to the run that already happened in the worktree, not to the gate.

So there is no double run at the gate. The floor proves the command passed in-worktree; acceptance judges whether the diff honors the oracle's assertions. They are different operations — execute, then inspect — not one check run twice.

The command does get re-executed, but later and at higher altitudes: merge re-validates the oracle against the merged tip, so the check passes on what actually lands and not just on the item branch; and the project's CI is the final altitude, the authoritative run on the integrated result. A failure that the in-worktree floor cleared can still surface at merge or in CI when the tip has moved — that is the point of re-running there.

This overlap is only about the floor and the gate looking redundant. The genuine two-phase model stays intact for an assertion-bearing oracle — assertions the command does not itself check, a `visual` oracle, or a `contract` artifact: the floor clears compile/type-check/lint, then acceptance dispositions each assertion (or `karta-validate` compares rendered output, or the gate checks the contract artifact) on its own.

## Advisory hooks

Any pre-tool hook a project wires in stays advisory: it exits 0 and never blocks. The gate blocks, not the hook. The hook can warn at edit time, but the authoritative judgment is the gate running on the actual diff in a fresh session — which self-corrects within its caps, then escalates or halts. A hook that hard-failed would be a second, hidden gate; karta keeps exactly one.
