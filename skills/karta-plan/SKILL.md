  Analyze a problem/feature description and/or a design mock or non-functional prototype and synthesize a validated binder of work items for ad-hoc orchestration; stack-agnostic (frontend, backend, CLI, data, library/SDK, IaC, mobile, ML, docs — UI is one stack among many); emits .karta/binders/<slug>.json. The draft is reviewed as an editable in-chat card — or one plannotator browser annotation session when that separately-installed CLI is present — and commits only on the explicit "commit" verb. Trigger phrases: "plan this with karta", "synthesize a binder", "break this work into a binder", "karta-plan this feature".
---

karta-plan ingests intent and — without fail — synthesizes a binder. Give it a problem or feature description; optionally attach a design mock or non-functional prototype. It asks a minimal set of questions, runs a synthesis subagent to draft the binder, and commits on an explicit "commit" verb. The output lands at `.karta/binders/<slug>.json` and is validated by `validate_binder.py` before any build run.

## How this skill adapts to your project

karta-plan is **stack-agnostic**. It plans frontend, backend, CLI, data pipelines, libraries/SDKs, IaC, mobile, ML, and docs work in the same way — UI is one stack among many, not the default.

**How it works:**

- Intent ingestion handles design exports too: when the input is a Claude Design or runtime-JSX export, the UI-analysis path applies (component inventory, token map, icon map). This is a **stack-specific aside**, not a precondition for the whole skill.
- A synthesis subagent drafts the binder from ingested intent.
- A minimal interview loop asks only what it cannot detect.
- Commit-on-verb: the binder is presented as an editable card and committed when you say "commit."
- Review is smart-surfaced: the synthesis subagent flags items that warrant human attention (`surface.flagged` + `surface.signals`); unflagged items don't require a per-card walk.

**Scope limits (V1):**

- Repo detection is light and never blocks (see Project configuration below).
- When the scope spans multiple natural binders that must land in order, it emits a *set* of self-sufficient binders (each independently valid and mergeable) and suggests the run order — see Phase 5. Default is still one binder; a set is the exception, not the reflex.
- Synthesis runs as a single subagent, not a panel.

## Project configuration (resolve once, never blocking)

Resolve in order: **explicit user input → detect from the repo → ask the user** (batch all unknowns into one question). Skip what you can detect. When detection conflicts with the project's stated stack, the stated stack wins — a repo can be mid-migration.

| Setting | What it is | How to resolve |
|-|-|-|
| **Stack** | The primary tech domain (frontend, backend, CLI, data, IaC, mobile, ML, docs, mixed) | Detect from repo layout, package manifests, and language files; ask when ambiguous |
| **Toolchain commands** | lint / test / build / typecheck invocations | Detect from package scripts, task runners (npm/pnpm/yarn, Makefile, Nx, Turborepo, Cargo, Poetry, etc.) |
| **CI-facing checks** | The subset of commands that gate CI (used as oracle `command` values) | Detect from CI workflow files; if absent, use the toolchain commands |
| **Env command** | The command that starts the dev/test environment (feeds `env_contract.command`) | Detect from package scripts or a `docker-compose.yml`; ask if not found |
| **Required runtime** | The language/toolchain runtime versions the commands need (feeds `runtime_contract`) | Detect from version-manager pin files (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, `.python-version`, `mise`/`asdf` config) and manifest fields (`package.json` `engines`/Volta, `pyproject.toml` `requires-python`); ask for the floor only when nothing pins it but a tool is known to gate on a minimum |
| **Repo direction docs** | Architecture docs, ADRs, or decision records | Detect: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`; cite only filled docs (skip placeholder templates); ask when context is thin |
| **Project rules** | Conventions the repo documents (lint configs, contributor guides, rules files) | Detect; verify the doc has real content before citing |
| **Repo policy** | CI/branch/deployment policy (only when in planning scope) | Read root/area `AGENTS.md`, workflows, and CI docs; load [references/ci-policy.md](references/ci-policy.md) and [references/policy-yagni.md](references/policy-yagni.md) |
| **stack packs** | Advisory domain-expert do's/don'ts to apply (each with an enforceable Review checklist) | Match the built-in [references/sme/](references/sme/) plus the project overlay `.karta/sme/*.md` against the dependencies/languages reported by `scripts/detect_stack.py`; record matched ids in the binder's `sme` |

Resolved values feed the binder's `design_facts.stack`, `env_contract`, `runtime_contract`, and each oracle's `command`. Record them — every later phase references them.

### UI / design-token annex (conditional)

When the resolved stack has a design or token surface, also resolve:

- **Component library:** detect from package deps and import statements; may be none.
- **Icon libraries:** detect from deps/imports; may be none.
- **Token/theme system:** detect a theme object, CSS custom properties, a design-tokens file (incl. W3C DTCG JSON — see [references/dtcg-tokens.md](references/dtcg-tokens.md)), a utility-class config, or plain CSS.

When the **token system** is a W3C DTCG file (JSON leaves carrying `$value`/`$type`), resolve the additional DTCG-only settings in [references/dtcg-tokens.md](references/dtcg-tokens.md) so the binder's `token_manifest` and each work item's `token_changes` can carry tier-correct, build-actionable guidance.

Resolved UI values feed the binder's `design_facts` and each work item's `component_map`, `icon_map`, and `token_changes` (see [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md) — these fields are UI-optional and omitted when the stack has no design surface).

## Workflow

### Phase 0 — Ingest intent (light gate)  `plan:ingest`

Accept a problem or feature description as the only hard requirement. Optionally accept a path to a design mock or non-functional prototype. Some statement of intent is required — if the user provides nothing, ask once.

**Repo detect (light, never blocking).** Check for a recognizable repo layout to resolve the binder's landing path and later feed the repo survey (`plan:survey`). Never fail on an unfamiliar structure.

**UI-format gate (conditional).** When the input includes a design file path, check whether it is a Claude Design or runtime-JSX export: verify that `.jsx` siblings exist or the HTML contains a `<script type="text/babel">` block. If the check fails, tell the user what was found and ask them to re-export or point at the `.jsx` sources. Only run this check when a design file is provided; a plain text description has no format to gate.

**Resolve the binder location.** In order: explicit user input → detect an existing `.karta/binders/` directory in the repo → default to `.karta/binders/<slug>.json`. Ask the user only when you cannot determine `<slug>` from the intent.

---

### Phase 1 — Best-effort repo + stack understanding (Explore subagent)  `plan:survey`

Use an **Explore subagent** OR an inline read-only pass to survey the repo. Both are sanctioned; when the host cannot spawn the subagent, run inline — but note in what you show the user that the survey ran inline, rather than letting the degraded path pass unremarked.

**Subagent brief:**

Survey the repo at `<root>`. Identify the primary tech domain (frontend, backend, CLI, data pipeline, library/SDK, IaC, mobile, ML, docs, or mixed). Identify the toolchain: how the project lints, tests, builds, and type-checks (look at package scripts, task runners — npm/pnpm/yarn, Makefile, Nx, Turborepo, Cargo, Poetry, Gradle, etc. — and any CI workflow files). Determine the env command: what starts the dev or test environment. Determine the required runtime: read version-manager pin files (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, `.python-version`, `mise`/`asdf` config) and manifest fields (`package.json` `engines`/Volta, `pyproject.toml` `requires-python`, a `go` directive in `go.mod`, `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`) for the language/toolchain versions the commands need. Read any architecture, ADR, or decision docs you find (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/architecture/`, `docs/decisions/`, `adr/`, `AGENTS.md`) — cite only docs with real content; skip placeholders. Read project rule and contributor convention files when present.

Report:
1. Resolved stack (one phrase, e.g. "Python/FastAPI backend + Postgres").
2. Toolchain commands for lint, test, build, and typecheck — with the exact invocations.
3. CI-facing checks: the subset of toolchain commands that gate CI (from workflow files, or fall back to the toolchain commands).
4. Env command.
5. Conventions and rules the repo documents.
6. Architecture or decision-record notes relevant to the stated intent (if any docs exist).
7. Required runtime: per runtime, the version or range and the pin file or manifest field it came from (`.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, `.python-version`, `engines`, `requires-python`, …). This feeds the binder's `runtime_contract`. Say so plainly when nothing pins a runtime — an absent floor is a clean result, not a gap to guess at.

When context is thin on a point, say so — the main thread will interview the user for the missing piece.

Report with `file:line` citations.

**UI annex — full design analysis (conditional).** When the resolved stack has a UI surface — a design mock or non-functional prototype as input, **or** a component-library / token system in the repo — run karta's full frontend analysis per **[references/ui-analysis.md](references/ui-analysis.md)** instead of the one-line inventory. Keep the Explore-subagent pattern: that reference drives three read-only passes (run them in parallel where the host allows), each citing `file:line`:

- **Design analysis** — component inventory (with props, complexity, state), the component-hierarchy tree, the page/view inventory, the design-token inventory *with values* (per theme context), mock-data shapes, and navigation structure (ui-analysis `ui:design`).
- **Codebase + component-library inventory** — existing components/routes/styles/data-layer/client-state/tests, the component-library catalog, icon libraries, and the theme/token inventory (incl. DTCG tier/path/name from the JSON source, resolved values from the generated output) (ui-analysis `ui:inventory`).
- **Data-layer mapping** — the type-coverage buckets (matched / gap / unused / exists-but-differs / field-level gap), operation mapping, schema gaps, and fetch-boundary planning (ui-analysis `ui:datalayer`).

When the token system is W3C DTCG (JSON leaves carrying `$value`/`$type`), also resolve the DTCG-only settings in [references/dtcg-tokens.md](references/dtcg-tokens.md) so the binder's `token_manifest` and each work item's `token_changes` carry tier-correct, build-actionable guidance.

Non-UI stacks skip this annex entirely — the base survey above is all they need.

<!-- karta:matching-rule:start — benchmarks/sme-static/match_pins.py pins the sha256 of the text between these markers so its replay implementation is re-verified whenever the rule changes. You may edit the rule, but keep both markers; adding a **-lead paragraph inside them changes the hash (re-run the gate to re-pin), while paragraphs outside them do not. -->
**stack pack matching (after the survey)  `plan:sme`.** karta ships curated stack packs — advisory do's/don'ts per stack, each with an enforceable Review checklist — and a project may add its own. Once the survey completes, select the packs that apply:

1. Detect dependencies deterministically: run `python3 skills/karta-plan/scripts/detect_stack.py <repo-root>` (stdlib-only) during the survey. It scans the repo's manifests (package.json, pyproject.toml, requirements*.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, Gemfile, composer.json) and prints `{"dependencies": [...], "languages": [...]}`. That JSON is the **only** matching input. The survey's one-phrase stack summary stays — for human reporting — but it is not a matching input.
2. Enumerate available packs. A pack's identity is its **file basename** (sans `.md`); the frontmatter `name` must equal it (`validate_packs.py` enforces this), so pinning here and resolution at verify time use one identity. Enumerate the project overlay `.karta/sme/*.md` in the repo, laid over the built-ins in [references/sme/](references/sme/). On a basename clash the project-local file wins. A file whose frontmatter carries `disabled: true` is a **suppression pack** — the sanctioned no-op override: enumerate it as suppressed, never pin it. (`platform-native.md` is shared reference data, not a pack — skip it; the packs link to it via `see_also`.)
3. Select the packs that apply, by frontmatter kind:
   - An **always-on stack pack** (`always: true`, e.g. `minimalism`) applies to **every** binder — unless the project suppresses it with a `disabled: true` overlay of the same basename.
   - A **matched stack pack** (`match: [tokens]`) applies when a match token equals — case-insensitively — a name in detect_stack.py's `dependencies` list or a `languages` entry. No substring matching, no matching against the stack phrase.
4. Collect the applied pack basenames — always-on and matched together — into the binder's `sme`. Every binder gets at least the unsuppressed always-on stack packs (e.g. `["minimalism"]`); a polyglot repo adds several stack packs (e.g. `["minimalism", "python", "python-fastapi", "angular"]`). A suppressed always-on pack is **not** pinned into `sme`; when every always-on pack is suppressed and nothing matches, `sme` is legitimately empty and `validate_binder.py`'s empty-`sme` warning is the expected, legitimate outcome — not a failure.

Because `sme` is matched from one repo survey, it is identical across every binder in a planning run unless a binder's scope genuinely excludes a stack.

Load the applied packs now — their guidance feeds synthesis (Phase 2) and their ids are pinned into the binder (Phase 5). These packs are **advisory for decomposition**: they shape how items are split, what each `contract` says, and which `oracle` assertions you choose; they never add a gate at plan time.
<!-- karta:matching-rule:end -->

**Provenance classification (read-only reporting).** As you enumerate the overlay packs (step 2), classify where each local copy came from, so the plan reports its origin next to the match result. Run `python3 skills/karta-plan/scripts/check_pack_provenance.py <repo-root>` and report each pack's state. A pack lands in exactly one of six states: `seeded cache` (a clean copy of the current built-in), `stale cache` (a clean copy of an older built-in), `suppression` (a `disabled: true` override), `project pack` (the project's own pack, with no built-in of that name), `illegal shadow` (a copy that carries a genuine local edit over the shipped built-in), or `orphaned cache` (its `seeded_from` names a built-in that no longer exists). The comparison is byte-level on canonicalized content; the provenance stamp is diagnostic only, never the cleanliness signal.

**Plan time is read-only.** This step classifies and reports — it never writes under `.karta/sme/`. Refreshing an out-of-date copy is auto-reseed, and auto-reseed is owned exclusively by the kaizen item; plan time only names it. Report a `stale cache` in one line that names the coming resolution — auto-reseed at the next kaizen pass — and carry on. Report an `illegal shadow` as a loud WARNING quoting `illegal shadow: a local delta over the shipped built-in` and naming the built-in it shadows. This release still lets the local overlay win — overlay-wins behavior, now documented as **deprecated**; nothing halts this release. The plan-time halt that turns an illegal shadow into a hard stop lands in karta 3.0.0.

**Project pack composition (`extends`).** A project pack no longer has to fork a whole built-in or suppress it wholesale to change one rule. A pack whose frontmatter carries `extends: <built-in basename>` **builds on** that built-in instead of replacing it:

- **Checklist appends.** The project pack's own `## Review checklist` items are **appended** to the extended built-in's checklist — the built-in's rules still apply, plus the project's. The project pack declares `id_prefix: <prefix>` and its own checklist ids use exactly that prefix (`validate_packs.py` enforces this); the appended rules are namespaced apart from the built-in's.
- **Match tokens are additive (union).** The combined pack fires when **either** the built-in's match tokens **or** the project pack's match tokens hit — the union, not a replacement. An `always: true` built-in stays always-on.
- **`exclude_rules` subtracts, visibly.** The project pack's `exclude_rules` — a JSON list of built-in rule ids, legal only alongside `extends` — **removes** those named rules from the combined checklist. Report the excluded ids at plan time the same way retired ledger entries are surfaced: an exclusion is **visible**, never silent. `validate_packs.py` rejects an `exclude_rules` entry that names a rule the extended built-in never had — a stale exclusion is a loud error, not a quiet no-op.
- **`id_prefix` uniqueness is enforced per repo at plan time.** Two project packs in the same repo claiming the same `id_prefix` is a **reported error** — fix the collision before pinning. (`validate_packs.py` already rejects an `id_prefix` that squats a prefix a shipped built-in registers; the per-repo cross-pack check is the plan-time addition.)
- **A dangling `extends` pointer resolves through the rename-alias table.** When a built-in was renamed upstream, an `extends` pointer at the old basename resolves through the rename-alias table shipped in `check_pack_provenance.py` (exposed in its JSON `aliases`, the single truth plan:sme and the docs both cite) — kept for **one minor release**, after which phase 2 retires the table and the stale pointer becomes an error.

---

### Phase 2 — Synthesize the binder (synthesis subagent; main thread owns judgment)  `plan:synthesize`

Decompose the stated intent into work items. Do not delegate this judgment — the synthesis subagent drafts; you review and own the output.

When the runtime cannot spawn the synthesis subagent (a host that gates delegation behind an explicit opt-in), **say so and synthesize inline in the main thread** — the binder is still yours to review and own, but the fresh-context draft/review separation was unavailable this run, so flag that plainly in what you show the user. Running inline is **not** licence to skip phases: still run the stack-pack match (`plan:sme`) and pin `sme[]` (every binder carries at least the unsuppressed always-on packs, e.g. `["minimalism"]`), and still apply every survey output. Degrade visibly; never drop steps silently.

**Subagent brief:**

Given the intent `<intent>` and the repo survey (`plan:survey`), draft a binder JSON that conforms to [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md).

**Domain guidance (when stack packs matched in `plan:sme`).** When one or more stack packs matched, their do's/don'ts are domain guidance for this synthesis. Decompose items, write `contract`s, and choose `oracle` assertions so they respect each matched stack's patterns and avoid its anti-patterns (e.g. an Angular slice's `contract` speaks in standalone-component / signals terms; a FastAPI item's `oracle` expects Pydantic-validated request/response shapes). This guidance shapes the plan; it never adds a plan-time gate.

For the binder level, populate:
- `slug` (kebab-case, derived from the feature name). A slug must be **fresh**: it is taken if `.karta/binders/<slug>.json` exists, if `.karta/binders/archive/<slug>.json` exists (a delivered binder — its slug is retired), or if the `refs/karta/<slug>/` namespace or `karta/<slug>/*` tags survive in git (a delivered run's refs would read as the new binder's own state and silently skip its work). Pick another slug rather than reuse one; `validate_binder.py` and the status engine warn when a live binder shadows an archived slug.
- `title` (a friendly binder name a person reads first — not the slug, e.g. "Tag editing for notes")
- `summary` (the plain-language goal in 1-2 sentences: what this binder delivers and why it matters)
- `motivation` (one sentence)
- `scope.included` and `scope.excluded`
- `design_facts.source` (path to the design, or null) and `design_facts.stack` (from `plan:survey`)
- `env_contract.command`, `env_contract.supports_isolation`, and `env_contract.isolation_params` (from `plan:survey`)
- `runtime_contract` when the project pins a runtime floor: one `runtimes` entry per runtime (`name`, the required `version`/range, and an optional `manager` — the version manager that pins it, e.g. `nvm`/`mise`), plus `on_unavailable` (always `halt` — karta never auto-provisions or selects a runtime). Detect the floor from version-manager pin files and manifest fields (`engines`, `requires-python`), then record the resolved `version`; omit the whole object when no runtime floor exists
- `token_manifest` only when the stack has a token system
- `sme` — the stack pack ids pinned in `plan:sme`. An always-on pack applies to every binder, so an empty `sme` is legitimate only when every always-on pack is suppressed by a `disabled: true` overlay and nothing else matched — never because the match step was skipped

For each work item, set:
- `id` (kebab-case, unique)
- `title` (short human label)
- `summary` (the plain-language goal in one sentence: what this item does)
- `estimate` (`S`, `M`, or `L`)
- `depends_on` (IDs of items that must land first)
- `contract` (the open-shape interface this item exposes or consumes — be specific; vague contracts produce unverifiable oracles)
- `oracle` per [references/definition-of-done.md](references/definition-of-done.md): a real CI-facing check oracle (`type`, `command`, `assertions`) OR an explicit opt-out (`opt_out: true`, `reason: "…"`). The floor is compile + type-check + lint. Use opt-out only when a genuinely better check already exists and recording it here would be redundant — always provide a reason.
- `serialize: true` and `shared_resources` for items that must not run in parallel (e.g. DB migrations, lock-file changes).
- `touches`: the concrete files/paths each item creates or modifies. This gives the parallelism file-collision and shared-resource gates structured data instead of prose to infer from, and `validate_binder.py` uses it to flag two same-wave items (no dependency edge between them) whose `touches` overlap unless one declares `serialize` or they share a `shared_resources` entry. Populate it for every item; without it the collision gate falls back to unenforced inference.
- UI-only fields (`design_reference`, `component_map`, `icon_map`, `token_changes`) only when the stack has a design surface. Omit them entirely for backend, CLI, data, and other non-UI stacks.

**Write the human prose in plain language.** The binder `title`/`summary` and each work item's `title`/`summary` are what a person reads in Karta Watch. Write them with the bundled **karta-plainlanguage** standard: lead with the reader, plain words over jargon, active voice, and no kebab-case identifiers in the prose. The `slug` and `id` stay the technical anchors; the `title` and `summary` are for humans — a `title` that just restates the slug, or a `summary` that restates the title, fails this bar.

**Multi-root / polyglot oracle commands.** When the repo has more than one toolchain root (e.g. a Python service at the root plus an Angular app under `frontend/`), do not emit a bare oracle `command` that assumes a single root — `ruff && pytest && npm run lint && ng build` resolves `ng` from nowhere at the root and forces build to improvise a shim. Express each segment through the runner's own root-targeting flag so every tool resolves from its own root with no synthetic structure: `uv run pytest` at the root, `npm --prefix frontend run lint`, `pnpm -C frontend build`, `make -C api test` (see [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md), "Execution context"). Set the oracle's `cwd` to the segment's root when the whole command lives in one sub-tree; use the runner's root-targeting when one command must drive several roots. This tool-resolution rule holds for **every** oracle command, single-root included: author a Python tool through the project's venv entrypoint (`uv run ruff`, `uv run pytest`, `uv run mypy`) — never a bare `ruff`/`pytest` that assumes a global install — and a Node tool through its package script/runner (`npm … run`, `npx`). Write the command the way it actually resolves in the project so the build worker never has to rewrite it.

**For UI items — populate the UI fields from the analysis (conditional).** When the stack has a UI surface, decompose the UI work and fill its fields using **[references/ui-analysis.md](references/ui-analysis.md)** and the survey (`plan:survey`) analysis it produced:

- Break UI work into items with the **vertical-slice heuristics** (foundation slice if the library/theme isn't integrated; one slice per page/view; split list + detail; complex reusable components; cross-cutting features; modals bundled with their view) — ui-analysis `ui:slice`.
- Set `estimate` to the **S/M/L** size from the slice's component count and per-component complexity — ui-analysis `ui:slice`.
- Set `design_reference` to the view/route the slice renders (or `none` for a pure setup/foundation item).
- Populate `component_map` from the **component-to-library mapping** (Library match / Library + wrapper / Custom / Composite), `icon_map` from the **icon mapping** (primary → fallback → custom SVG, with the Source column and any missing-icon flags), and `token_changes` from the **design-token mapping** (no-consumable-tier-match tokens recorded as semantic-additive entries with per-context values and Auth) — ui-analysis `ui:components`, `ui:icons`, `ui:tokens`. Put the shared design→project token map in the binder-level `token_manifest`.

Non-UI items keep the stack-agnostic synthesis above and carry none of these fields.

**Foundation / greenfield items (any stack).** A foundation item creates a project from nothing — the first item in a binder that has no integration branch yet and whose contract is to stand up the project, not edit against existing conventions. Trigger greenfield mode off that existing first-item/foundation signal, not a separate judgment call: the project does not exist yet, so there is nothing to detect and no convention to match. When you plan such an item:

- State in the item's `scope.included` and `contract` that it runs the framework's own official generator (e.g. `ng new`, `create-next-app`, `cargo new`, `npm create vite@latest`, `django-admin startproject`). These generators are deterministic and blessed — the framework's own way to lay down a working baseline. Bound the scaffold to the item's contract: set `scope.excluded` to keep generated sample features, demo pages, and unrequested add-ons out, since the generator's footprint is wider than the item. Build trims it and notes generated-but-unused files in its report (it does not edit the read-only binder).
- Keep the oracle as the real CI-facing check. When the oracle names a check a bare scaffold won't ship (a fresh `ng new` has no `ng lint` / `npm run lint` target), note in the contract that the item must satisfy it through the framework's own official add/plugin command — e.g. `ng add @angular-eslint`, which installs the linter and wires the `lint` target. Provisioning the named tooling is part of the foundation item's work. Do not opt the check out, downgrade it to what the empty scaffold passes, or hand-invent config. A named check that exists but fails is a real failure, never the absent-check carve-out. If no official mechanism exists to satisfy a named check, the item must halt with a call to action rather than improvise.
- Note that the project's toolchain and oracle commands are re-resolved after the generator runs — before the scaffold there is nothing to detect. The pre-scaffold survey is best-effort; the real commands land once the project exists.
- Decide the project's lockfile policy at this foundation item, not per later item: an application commits its generated lockfile (`uv.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, …) so every worktree and CI resolve the same dependency graph (see [references/definition-of-done.md](references/definition-of-done.md), Lockfiles). State it in the item's `scope.included`/`contract` so build tracks it rather than leaving it untracked.
- Expect the scaffold's footprint to trip the smart-surfaced-review boundary signals at the safety gate (a foundation item touches many new files at once). Pre-justify it in the item's surfacing note so it reads as expected, not as a red flag.

**Oracle traceability rule.** Each oracle assertion must be traceable to the item's `contract`. If an assertion references a field, shape, or behavior the `contract` does not declare, flag the gap now — emit the work item with a note that the contract needs expanding rather than writing an assertion that cannot be verified.

**Propose shared-term candidates  `plan:terms`.** After drafting the items, read every `contract` at once and propose a `shared_terms` entry for each string two or more items must render identically (see [references/binder-reference.md](references/binder-reference.md) — `id`, the `canonical` substring, and the `items` that must render it). Two signals raise a candidate:

- **Explicit** — a `contract` that says an item must quote or match another item's string verbatim. Turn that declared edge into a `shared_terms` entry so the invariant is machine-checkable, not just prose.
- **Overlap** — two or more items whose contracts describe emitting the same user-facing string or message. Propose the stable substring they share as `canonical` and list those items.

Each candidate is a proposal, not a commitment: it surfaces in the plan review card (`plan:surface`) for the human to confirm into the binder — surfacing is **advisory, not a gate**. This is the **only** point in karta with cross-item visibility — the planner reads every contract at once, where the per-item build and deliver gates each see one item in isolation — so it is the one place the overlap can be caught. It is **best-effort, not a guarantee**: a shared term nobody surfaces here is never declared, so it is never enforced downstream.

Return the draft binder JSON.

---

After the subagent returns, review the draft. Check:
- The binder has a human `title` and a plain-language `summary`, and every work item has a one-sentence `summary` — none of them just restate the slug/id.
- Every work item has an `id`, a `contract`, and an `oracle`.
- `depends_on` references resolve to real IDs in this binder (no dangling refs).
- Oracle assertions trace to the item's contract.
- `serialize`/`shared_resources` are set for any items that write shared state (migrations, lock files, config that multiple items touch).
- UI fields are present only on items with a UI surface.
- `sme` lists exactly the packs pinned in `plan:sme`. An empty `sme` is legitimate only when every always-on pack is suppressed by a `disabled: true` overlay — empty without that suppression means `plan:sme` was skipped; go back and run it.

Fix gaps in the main thread before proceeding.

### Phase 3 — Smart-surfaced review (the one human-in-the-loop point)  `plan:surface`

Per [references/smart-surfaced-review.md](references/smart-surfaced-review.md): compute the seven boundary signals for each work item and write `surface { flagged, signals }` into the binder. When a signal cannot be computed yet (no diff, no path conventions), record `not-computed:<signal-name>` in `surface.signals` rather than giving a clean pass.

Write everything you show a person in plain language — see [references/user-facing-prose.md](references/user-facing-prose.md).

Show the user which items are flagged and why. Then give them three ways to go:

- **Review all** — walk every work item.
- **Review flagged only** — walk only the flagged items.
- **Accept as-is** — skip the walk and move on.

Keep the list short: don't show oracle details for routine, unflagged items. Settle any decisions here so the deliver and build steps can run hands-off.

### Phase 4 — Cost education  `plan:cost`

When the binder has many work items or several large (`L`) estimates, tell the user plainly: this scope will cost time and real money before anything lands. Suggest a smaller first slice — the items with no `depends_on` that form the first wave — as a lower-risk start.

Educate; don't forbid. If the user wants the full scope, move on.

---

### Phase 5 — Emit, validate, and commit  `plan:emit`

**Write the binder(s)** to the resolved location (`.karta/binders/<slug>.json`).

**When the work is one sequence of stages, emit a set.** Split into an ordered set of binders only when **either** the user asks for separate ordered binders (e.g. *"new first, then edit, then delete — separate binders"*) **or** the work genuinely needs ordered, separately-mergeable stages — the expand → migrate → contract shape is the canonical one (see [references/example-sequence/](references/example-sequence/)). Each binder in the set is a normal, self-sufficient binder: it must pass `validate_binder.py` on its own and leave the tree green on its own (e.g. *new* adds standalone code, *edit* rewires call sites, *delete* removes the now-dead code). Slugs are **descriptive and unique, grouped by a shared prefix, and carry no sequence number** (`note-tags-new`, `note-tags-edit`, `note-tags-delete`) — a number would be a stored order that rots when the set changes.

**Emit `after` edges when emitting a set.** For each binder in the set except the first, set its top-level `after` to the slug(s) of its immediate predecessor(s) in the suggested order — `note-tags-edit` carries `"after": ["note-tags-new"]`, `note-tags-delete` carries `"after": ["note-tags-edit"]`, and `note-tags-new` carries no `after` at all (it has no predecessor). The `after` field is the **only** persisted cross-binder dependency. (An `after` may also name an already-delivered binder — one karta-deliver archived to `.karta/binders/archive/` — which the status engine resolves as satisfied, not dangling.) The run order the user sees in Phase 6 is the topo sort the engine derives from these edges — which means `karta-status`'s live order and this plan-time advice are always the same sort over the same stored edges. Only the edge is stored; the order is derived, never stored. Do **not** write a sequence manifest or encode order in slugs.

**Validate it.** Run:

```
uv run --script skills/karta-plan/scripts/validate_binder.py --binder <path>
```

The validator is pure stdlib (no dependencies), so `uv run --script`, `uv run`, or `python3` all run it. Do not proceed on a validation failure. Fix the binder and re-validate until it passes. **For a set, validate every binder** — each must pass on its own before you present the set.

**Single-work-item hatch.** A binder with exactly one work item can skip the deliver phase and go straight to build. Tell the user this option exists; let them make the call.

**Review surface — in-chat card, or a plannotator annotation session.** The editable card has an optional second surface: a browser annotation session over the same card(s), through the separately-installed plannotator CLI. The surface changes how the user reviews; it changes no gate and no verb — committing still takes the explicit `commit`.

- **Probe** for the CLI first (cross-shell; exit 0 = installed):

  ```
  uv run python -c "import shutil,sys; sys.exit(0 if shutil.which('plannotator') else 1)"
  ```

  On a failed probe, skip this block silently — never mention plannotator, offer nothing; the flow is the in-chat card exactly as below. Do not retry.
- **Offer** (probe succeeded), recommendation-first, through the host's user-input facility:

  > **Recommended: plannotator** — one browser session over the whole binder reads faster than a card-by-card chat walk, and every gate still runs.
  >
  > Verbs: `card` — review in chat · `plannotator` — annotate in a browser session
- **The annotation session** (chosen): render the card(s) to a session-scratch markdown file (the host's scratch area or a temp path — never committed, never under `.karta/binders/`): the binder frame first, then every work item in dependency order carrying the same fields the chat card shows — title, summary, contract, `touches`, oracle, `depends_on`, and any smart-surfaced flags. Hand the file to a blocking plannotator session (the `plannotator-annotate` skill where the host lists it, else the CLI directly) and wait for the returned feedback. Ingest by mapping each annotation onto binder-field edits; an annotation that maps to no binder field unambiguously is asked back in chat against that item — never guessed. Re-run the validator after applying the edits; it must pass before the card is presented for commit.

**Commit on the `commit` verb.** Show the binder — or, for a set, every binder — as an editable card (annotated-session runs: the updated card summary). Commit only when the user says "commit"; a set commits together, in one commit. Once committed, a binder is read-only to every later build step.

---

### Phase 6 — Report back  `plan:report`

Lead with the binder path and the total work-item count, then give the user:

- **Work order** — the item IDs in dependency order (topological sort), and the dependency chain.
- **Flagged for review** — the IDs and the signals that flagged each one.
- **Opted-out items** — the IDs and their recorded reasons (from the validator's opt-out summary).
- **First wave** — the items with no `depends_on`. These can start right away.
- **Experts applied** — the `sme` packs in effect for this binder (or *none*).

**For a set, also state the run order — as the topo sort derived from the `after` edges.** Name the binders in the order the engine derives: *first* `<slug>`, *next* `<slug>`, *then* `<slug>`, and remind the user to review and merge each before starting the next. The order is derived here from the `after` edges stored in each binder — which means this spoken advice and `karta-status`'s live ordering are always the same topo sort over the same edges. Only the edges are stored; the order is derived, never written separately. The user moves between binders manually.

## Gotchas

- **The binder is always synthesized.** karta-plan never exits early with a plan outline or a list of tickets. The output is a validated `.json` binder or nothing.
- **UI fields are conditional, not universal.** `design_reference`, `component_map`, `icon_map`, and `token_changes` belong only on items with a UI surface. Emitting them on a migration, a CLI command, or a data pipeline item is a schema error — the validator will catch it, but don't write it in the first place.
- **The oracle is a real CI-facing check.** It is not a self-grading statement ("implementation looks correct") or a description of what the item does. It is the command you'd want CI to run and the assertions you'd want to confirm.
- **Opt-out is explicit and recorded.** There is no silent opt-out. Every `opt_out: true` requires a `reason`. karta reports opted-out items after every run so nothing slips through unnoticed.
- **Don't delegate synthesis judgment.** The synthesis subagent drafts; the main thread reviews, corrects, and owns the binder. Cross-referencing contracts, oracle traceability, and dependency order requires judgment — do not hand that off.
- **Validate before commit.** A binder that fails `validate_binder.py` is not a valid binder. Fix it before presenting it to the user for commit.
- **A sequence is a set of self-sufficient binders; order is derived, never stored.** When scope spans multiple natural binders that must land in order, emit them as a set — each independently valid and mergeable, sliced expand → migrate → contract so each leaves the tree green. Slugs are descriptive and unique (no sequence number). Each binder except the first carries an `after` field naming its immediate predecessor(s); `after` is the only persisted cross-binder dependency. No sequence manifest, no ordering in slugs. The run order is derived (topo sort) from the edges — it is never stored directly. Movement between binders is the user's, done manually. Default is still one binder.
- **The binder is read-only once committed.** Build steps read the binder; they do not modify it. A build step that tries to rewrite its own work item's oracle or estimate is corrupting its own governance.
