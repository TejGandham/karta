# Fixed-fixture per-phase cost baseline

**Question.** On a pinned fixture repo and a canned binder, what does one karta delivery cost per phase in tokens and wall-clock — measured identically across plugin versions so the number is a true regression signal, unconfounded by repo or stack?

## Procedure

1. One-time: create `benchmarks/perf/fixture-v1/` = {`repo.tar.gz` (frozen tiny karta-testbed-shape repo with own git history and pre-committed `.karta/binders/bench.json`: one S unit-oracle item + one M integration-oracle item, no UI), `settings.json` (permission allowlist the delivery needs), `runner.sh`, README recording the pin mechanism}. Fixture bytes are immutable; a plugin release that breaks the binder schema mints fixture-v2 and RESETS the baseline — never compare across fixture versions.
2. Per release (n=3): `RUN_ROOT=$(mktemp -d /tmp/karta-bench.XXXXXX); tar -xzf repo.tar.gz -C $RUN_ROOT` — never a session scratchpad (its path changes every session and scrambles the `~/.claude/projects` mapping).
3. Pin plugin: git worktree/clone of the karta repo at tag `v<X.Y.Z>` into `$RUN_ROOT/plugin`, registered as a local plugin source in `$RUN_ROOT/repo/.claude/settings.json` — mechanism fixed in the README, identical every quarter.
4. `cd $RUN_ROOT/repo && timeout 90m claude -p '/karta:karta-deliver bench' --output-format stream-json --permission-mode bypassPermissions > run$i.jsonl`; `/usr/bin/time -v` wraps it for wall+RSS.
5. Classify: COMPLETE iff both item tags exist on the integration branch AND the stream ends in a success result AND no AskUserQuestion/human-prompt event occurred (`skills/karta-deliver/SKILL.md:122` enforces a live human waiver channel — headless, that is a stall, not a datapoint); INCOMPLETE runs are committed with reason and excluded from aggregates.
6. Mine: compute the mangled `~/.claude/projects` dir from `$RUN_ROOT/repo`, take `.jsonl` files with mtime in the run window, run `benchmarks/perf/mine_fixture.py` (shared with perf-delivery-telemetry's `mine_sessions.py` if that ships first; else this vector builds it) emitting per run: spawned-context count per item, per-phase turn counts, verify-retry count, merge-time re-validation count, per-phase output tokens, wall minutes, resolved model-ID set, claude CLI version.
7. Compare vs the previous release's committed JSON: PRIMARY = structural counts (spawns/item, retries, re-validation passes) — expected exactly reproducible across all 3 repeats; any cross-version drift is the flagged finding, no statistics needed. SECONDARY = median output-tokens/item and wall-min/item with [min,max]; flag only if the median shifts >25% AND the resolved model-ID set is unchanged; if the model set changed (opus/sonnet aliases in `agents/*.md` float across refreshes), record 'model refresh — cost delta not attributable this quarter' instead of a verdict (join against `benchmarks/epochs/epochs.json` from model-refresh-sentinel).
8. Commit `benchmarks/perf/results/<date>-fixture-v1-plugin-v<X.Y.Z>.json` including INCOMPLETE runs.
9. Dropped from the draft: promptfoo as a per-vector requirement (adds nothing over `claude -p` here) and bayes_evals paired_comparisons (6 paired observations cannot support credible-interval claims; exact-match on near-deterministic counts plus a coarse threshold is the honest comparator).

## Metric and comparability

PRIMARY: structural counts (spawned contexts per item, verify retries, merge-time re-validation passes) — expected exactly reproducible across 3 repeats; any cross-version drift is the flagged finding. SECONDARY: median output-tokens/item and wall-min/item with [min,max], flagged only if median shifts >25% AND resolved model-ID set unchanged; model-set change = 'model refresh — not attributable this quarter'. INCOMPLETE runs committed with reason, excluded from aggregates. Never compare across fixture versions.

The number stays honest across releases because the fixture bytes are immutable and a schema-breaking release mints fixture-v2 with a baseline RESET rather than a cross-fixture comparison; the plugin pin mechanism is fixed in the README and identical every quarter; cost deltas are attributed only when the resolved model-ID set is unchanged, with model refreshes joined against `benchmarks/epochs/epochs.json` and recorded as non-attributable; and every run — including INCOMPLETE ones with their reason — is committed to `benchmarks/perf/results/` so the aggregate denominator is auditable.

## Inputs

- `benchmarks/perf/fixture-v1/` (new, frozen)
- `benchmarks/perf/mine_fixture.py` (shared lineage with `mine_sessions.py`)
- karta repo release tags (plugin pinning)
- `benchmarks/epochs/epochs.json` (model-refresh-sentinel epoch authority)
- `skills/karta-deliver/SKILL.md:122` (human waiver channel — headless stall classifier)

## Seed observation (v2.21.0, 2026-07-17)

No comparable cross-version number exists today — the first run establishes the 2.21.0 baseline. From live mining, expect roughly 3-4 spawned contexts per trivial item (builder + acceptance + safety), ~40k+ output tokens per item, and double-digit minutes wall even on a toy fixture, dominated by the opus gate pair and merge-time re-validation. Known confound pinned in-procedure: acceptance-reviewer and safety-auditor pin model by 'opus' ALIAS, so cross-quarter token/wall deltas can be model refreshes — hence the model-ID-set gate.
